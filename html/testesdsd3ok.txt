O 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Work  has  changed  and  it  is  changing, 
this  could  have  been  said  at  any  time  in 
history.  The  very  meaning  of  the  word 
"work" is multiple and changed throughout 
time. Etymologically, its origins go back to 
the  Latin  word 
tripalium  which  means  a 
torture device [1]. 
In  the  Greek  society,  only  slaves  or 
second-class citizens used to work as it was 
mainly  a  physical  activity  considered 
undesirable  by  the  upper-class  people  [2]. 
Work remained as an activity reserved for 
the unfortunate on the medieval ages as it 
was  considered  something  terrible  by  the 
Catholic  Church  and  the  nobles  [3].  The 
ethics  of  the  religious  denominations  that 
derived  from  the  Protestant  Reformation 
went in direct opposition with the Catholic 
perspective of work   by  viewing  it  as  a 
mean to salvation [4]. 
This  change  in  the  meaning  of  work 
was extremely important for the Industrial 
Revolution that was to follow for it provided 
the cultural and moral justification to keep 
people  working  for  at  least  16  hours  per 
day.  The  industrial  revolutions  deserve 
special consideration in the history of work 
as they represent "profound changes in the 
means of production" [5], in these periods 
work  suffered  severe  changes  in  a  short 
period of time. 
The  1
st  Industrial  Revolution -  which 
took  place  in  the  XVIII  century - 
represented  the  shift  from  an  artisanal 
production  to  the  factory  mode  of 
production  boosted  by  the  new  steam-
powered machines [5]. Several intellectuals 
perceived  the  changes  happening  in  this 
period  and -  even  though  their  accounts 
differed  in  several  ways -  there  are  some 
points of convergence. For example, Smith 
and  Marx  saw  how  the  work  done  by  the 
artisans  was  being  replaced  by  a  highly 
specialized work and that work organization 
was bringing several negative effects to the 
workers  and  positive  economic  results  [6], 
[7]. During  the  2
nd  Industrial  Revolution, 
when  electricity  was  applied  in  the 
production, work has also changed rapidly 
[5]. The characteristics of the factory system 
were  further  intensified  by  the  works  of 
entrepreneurs such as Taylor that brought 
the scientific administration to the factories 
and  Ford  that  sought  to  intensify  the 
division  and  specialization  of  work  by  the 
creation of the production lines[8], [9]. The 
electrification  of  production  meant  that 
machines  substituted  some  of  the  work 
done  by  the  people.  Around  that  time, 
Fayol's work helped to organize companies 
as the white-collar work was increasing[10]. 
The  invention  of  Information  and 
Computation  Technologies  (ICT)  and  its 
application  on  business  around  the  1970s 
represent  the  main  event  of  the  3
rd 
Industrial  Revolution  [11].  With  the  ICTs 
came new industries and new types of jobs, 
the  main  product  of  many  companies 
became information and the third sector of 
the  economy  (services)  represented -  for 
the first time in history - the biggest share 
of GDP of several developed countries.  
Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), bio 
and nanotechnology are considered the tip 
of the iceberg of what might be called the 

4th  Industrial  Revolution  [12].  As  these 
technologies are further developed, we will 
see even more changes to work. This report 
will  discuss  the  main  trends  that  are 
affecting work and present some scenarios 
that might be part of the next chapters in 
the history (of the future) of work. 
Although  it  is  not  possible  to  predict 
the future, there are global trends showing 
us  forthcoming  changes  in  the  society.  In 
such  dynamic  world,  changes  occur  on  a 
continual basis - which makes us consider a 
long-term perspective for work. In this high-
automation low-employment context, skills 
development  becomes  an  important  long-
term  issue  [13].  Other  long-term  issues 
include  AI  regulation,  income  transfer 
programs, and the Non-Standard forms of 
Employment (NSE).  
OVERVIEW 
WORKING IN 2050   3 

 
 This  Report  explores  three  possible 
scenarios  for  Work  in  2050:  a  pessimist 
scenario,  in  which  the  development  and 
new technologies will bring unemployment and economic crisis; an optimistic scenario, in  which  the  development  and  new technologies will bring wealth and a welfare state;  and  a  likely  scenario,  in  which  the development  and  new  technologies  will 




The most likely scenario for work in 2050 presented in this report may be summarized in 13 
key points: 
1.
Automation continues to advance in industry, in contrast to the governments increase 
regulations and laws on the subject, continuing projects of insertion of new forms of 
work in society.  
2. Computerization will reduce the demand for low-skill and low-wage j
obs. After facing a 
period of unemployment, most people will train to new careers while some will not be 
able to do so relying on the state to provide them a basic income. The employment will 
change to create new opportunities: some economies will reduce the working hours, 
avoiding unemployment of higher skilled people. 
3. After a period of job insecurity and a series of disputes between Non-
Standard forms 
of Employment workers and their employees, the new types of work contracts will be 
better regulated in order to provide minimum worker rights. Traditional unions will 
help workers in new NSEs to organize themselves in order to fight for their rights and 
for better working conditions.  
4. A  transition  to  a  personalized  education  process  will  be  possible  by  using 
new 
technologies, which takes into account personal needs, interests and pace of learning. 
5. This personalized education and the trend of jobs automation will make reduce the
 
workload to the workers, giving them more free time to study and learn new skills, 
keeping them updated and involved in a lifelong learning. 
6. Workers will receive knowledge-intensive training, allowing their adaptation to 
the new 
types of jobs. 
7. The  collaboration  and  exchanges  will  increase,  as  well  as  the  self-
employment  and 
entrepreneurship in the global labor market.  
8. The society will demand more transparency and participation in political matters 
using 
new  technologies,  although  keeping  the  traditional  structures  of  governments. 
Minorities will use these new technologies and mediums to strengthen their movement 
for political empowerment. 
9.
The  population  will  age  and  legislations  will  be  amended  so  that  pensions  have 
increased ages. The government will play a more active and essential role in seeking a 
balance between the demand for jobs and supply, seeking to reduce the impact of 
unemployment. 
10.Universal Basic Income 
will not reach its full potential, but income transfer programs 
will be implemented for the most vulnerable population. Inequalities will continue and 
the government will play an important social role by taxing large fortunes. 
11.Knowledge-
intensive work and services will become more advanced. These types of 
jobs are seen as an opportunity for developing economies to reap technological and 
social benefits from technological learning, knowledge spillover and higher incomes. 
12.Alternative, sharing, social, green and creative economies will become more popular.  
13.Extreme poverty is going to decrease 
but inequality will be slightly higher than it is 
nowadays.

bring some benefits for the society, as well 
as some new challenges. The importance of 
this  report  relies  in  addressing  these 
challenges as soon as possible in order to 
produce efficient results in our society.  
We  took  some  assumptions  while 
performing our analysis until 2050. The first 
one  is  that  there  will  be  no  disruptive 
technological  breakthrough.  The  second 
one  is  that  will  be  no  large-scale  war - 
although asymmetric conflicts will continue 
to exist. Finally, the third one is that will be 
no global catastrophe. 
Therefore,  we  pointed  out  the  key 
themes  that  policy-makers,  entrepreneurs 
and  workers  should  discuss  in  the  near 
future. Although there is no right model to 
be  followed,  we  believe  that  these  actors 
should debate these topics:  
1. Robots  and  AI  Regulation: 
should  Robots  and  AI  be  limited  or 
forbidden, highly taxed in order to support 
income  transfer  programs,  or  be  left 
unregulated? 
2. Income  transfer  programs: 
should  the  government  create  income 
transfer  programs?  If  so,  which  model, 
Universal  Basic  Income,  Universal  Basic 
Assets or other? 
3. Non-Standard  forms  of 
Employment:  NSEs  should  be  regulated? 
Should  this  regulation  be  left  for  each 
country to decide or a global effort should 
be made in this direction? 
4. Flexible  Education: with the rise 
of  new  forms  of  education,  how  will  the 
governments  recognize  them?  Should  new 
kinds of degree separated from our current 
ones  or  as  part  of  the  current  curricula, 
adapting them to accept these new forms of 
education?  Leave  these  new  forms  of 
education unregulated is an option? 
The  findings  presented  in  this  report 
reflect  our  mission  to  conduct 
interdisciplinary  research  to  explore 
scenarios  and  to  base  solutions  for 
governments,  organizations  and  societies, 
helping  them  to  move  towards  a  more egalitarian,  participatory  and  sustainable society.

2. INCREASING AUTOMATION WILL 
IMPACT YOUR LIFE
 
Since the last century, computers have 
been  routinely  performing  physical 
activities  in  industries,  performing  better 
and being cheaper than humans. With new 
technologies, machines are getting closer to 
being able to make judgments and decision-
making.  Formerly,  such  capacities  were 
impossible for something non-human [14].  
Today  only  5%  of  occupations  are 
candidates for total automation, with total 
loss of human tasks [14]. Even so, almost all 
professions  have  partial  automation 
potential.  The  impact  of  automation  on 
workers is predictable in the production of 
physical  products,  especially  in  the  retail 
and  retail  market.  Collection  and  data 
processing  are  also  fully  automatable  and 
as  we  see  the  latest  assembly  line 
operations  and  archivists  suffer  from  the 
same problem. 
Some key points have to be considered 
when  talking  about  adopting  automation 
[14]: 

· Technical feasibility: The technique may be  in  the  prototype  phase,  making  it impossible to use it extensively.  
· Development  and  Implementation Costs: The cost of automation cannot be higher than the cost of hiring labor for the same task. 
· Labor  market  dynamics:  Demand  and costs related to human labor, which for social  reasons  may  make  the  use  of humans  more  favorable  than automation itself.  
· Economic  Benefits:  Government agencies fund projects in a given region can increase income according to labor laws.  Tax  reductions,  among  other incentives,  stimulate  the  development of  more  productive  and  wealthier regions. 
· Social Acceptance: Automation  may be badly  received  by  society  since  it  can generate  unemployment,  and  without popular  acceptance,  the  automation adoption becomes more complex.   
The effects of automation may be slow 
at the macro level in the economy, but at 
the micro level they can be very fast, with 
increasing  unemployment  in  a  particular 
region  or  monopoly  of  the  market  by 
companies with automated processes [14].  
2.1. WILL WE NEED POLICIES TO REGULATE 
ADVANCED 
AI AND ROBOTS? 
Artificial Intelligence is being developed 
for 60 years now, and over the last 20 years, 
remarkable progress has been made in this 
area.  In  2011,  Watson,  a  cognitive  system 
designed  by  IBM,  won  in  a  series  of 
questionnaires the champions of Jeopardy, 
Brad  Rutter  and  Ken  Jennings,  being  the 
first  moment  in  which  computers  beaten 
humans in this type of competition. In 2016, 
AlphaGo,  one  of  Google's  artificial 
intelligence  systems,  was  able  to  win  a 
game challenge with Lee Sedol, one of the 
best  professional  Go  players  in  the  world 
[15]. 
The  technological  wave  of  automation 
is  in  process.  The  costs  of  processing, 
memory,  bandwidth,  sensors  and  storage 
have  been  falling  exponentially.  Cloud 
computing  will  provide  all  the  necessary 
resources in a cheaper and clustered way. 
Data  obtained  from  digital  systems  will 
become  more  accurate  and  refined, 
allowing  for  accurate  experiments,  theory 
testing,  and  more  importantly  learning  to 
produce results without human supervision 
on an ever-increasing scale [16]. 
Billions  of  people  across  the  world 
grow  using  the  Internet,  being  more  and 
more connected, expanding and absorbing 
knowledge.  This  means  that  the  global 
population  of  innovators,  entrepreneurs 
and curious is growing rapidly and with  it 
advances in technology [16]. 
With advances in AI, there will probably 
be more robots or smart programs that can 
help  us  as  human  assistants,  such  as 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
WORKING IN 2050   7 

 
reading  emails,  cleaning  or  even  driving 
cars for us. However, this will also impact 
our  privacy,  security,  and  ethics.  Many 
uncontrolled consequences can arise if we 
are unable to identify the previously related 
threats [15]. 
Building  machines  that  can  learn  on 
their own is a key to this revolution, along 
with  new  regulatory  policies.  Historically, 
we have an automation problem: if, for any 
reason,  no  human  could  explain  all  the 
steps  taken  in  completing  a  task,  then  no 
programmer could incorporate those rules 
into software. Recent advances shows that 
this is not a great obstacle to be overcome 
anymore.  Machines  can  learn  even  when 
humans  cannot  teach  them  and  can  learn 
more  efficiently,  since  they  can  generate 
new  knowledge  alone  and  faster  than 
humans [16]. 
Technological advances have an impact 
on  the  way  work  is  done.  Such  a  radical 
reform of labor will require new policies to 
protect  the  vulnerable  unprepared  for  the 
new  age.  The  choices  made  now  will  be 
decisive  in  the  direction  to  be  followed. 
Erroneous  interventions  undermine  the 
economic  prospects  of  millions  of  people 
around the world, leaving  underdeveloped 
nations  out  of  the  race  against  the 
machines  of  more  developed  nations, 
thereby  creating  economic,  social  and 
political  inequality  as  technology  advances 
[17]. 
We  cannot  work  with  policies  that 
undermine  innovations  for  the 
development of society. The solution then is 
to  formulate  policies  that  allow  a  smooth 
transition to this new model of production 
[17]. 
Accepting this new model of production 
requires  a  pre-examination  since  not  all 
jobs  can  be  automated  by  a  variety  of 
economic, legal and regulatory advantages, 
such  as  police  or  medical,  at  least  in  the 
first stage of this new era. Jobs involving a 
high  creativity  load  are  not  affected  by automation  yet,  given  there  is  a  lack  of technology  and  knowledge  to  imitate  this human  behavior  in  the  area  of  artificial intelligence [17]. 
What  we  have  as  a  fact  is  that  mass 
automation will create new technologies in 
areas  such  as  AI  and  robotics,  creating 
entirely  new  jobs  that  will  generate 
additional wealth and expense [17]. 
This  discussion  is  delicate,  especially 
for  underdeveloped  nations,  which  are  at 
the  margin  of  the  discussion  and  of  the 
focus of studies in the area. Most jobs have 
characteristics  suitable  for  automation.  In 
such  cases,  intervention  from  government 
is required to ensure that these nations are 
prepared for the new era and that they can 
share  the  potential  gains  of  automation 
broadly  with  society  through  policies  such 
as  increased  investment  in  education  and 
vocational training [17]. 
Regarding  the  privacy  issue,  in  recent 
years the concept of machine learning has 
grown, so the number and quality of data 
sets  affect  the  results  of  the  machine 
training.  Therefore,  the  most  successful 
applications will require a large amount of 
data. The privacy issue is a major threat of 
exploiting  this  data,  inevitably  there  will 
also  be  privacy  issues  in  applications  that 
work with sensitive data [15]. 
2.2. HOW INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) 
WILL IMPACT US
? 
One  definition  of  Internet  of  Things  is 
"the  global  network  of  interconnected 
objects  exclusively  addressable  based  on 
standard communication protocols" [18]. A 
more generic definition of IoT is that it is a 
concept  of  interconnected  intelligent 
objects  that  work  together  to  achieve 
common goals [19]. 
The  advancement  of  technology  has 
provided the rapid development of low-cost 
sensors,  wireless  technologies  and  the 
generation of more data with the Internet. 
The  topics  covered  by  the  IoT  include 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
8 WORKING IN 2050 

P
K 
intelligent  transportation  and  logistics, 
smart  building,  environmental  monitoring, 
medical  and  health  care,  among  others. 
[19]. 
Predictions  for  the  number  of 
connected devices on the Internet of Things 
for  the  year  2020  vary  considerably,  from 
Gartner  26  billion  (Gartner)  to  30  billion 
(ABI  Research),  to  50  billion  (Cisco)  to  75 
billion (Morgan Stanley) [18]. 
The  impact  of  IoT  on  industrial 
automation  and  control  is  increasingly 
present in society. The evolution of sensor 
technologies  that  define  the  Internet  of 
Things  will  lead  to  lower  cost  automation 
systems and production maximization. The 
benefits  of  IoT  include  low-cost,  high-
performance  processors,  robust  low-cost 
sensors, analytical software, vision systems, 
cloud  computing,  and  highly  distributed 
system architectures [20].  
Many  companies  are  seeking  key 
knowledge  to  be  applied  for  competitive 
advantage  through  Big  Data  analysis. 
Therefore, companies that possess the skills 
needed  to  analyze  and  generate  business 
intelligence from several sources of data in 
real time will take the lead in the market. 
This  trend  follows  the  flow  of  increasingly 
steady use of mobile devices, social media 
tools, and the IoT with its milestone in RFID 
(Radio Frequency Identification) technology 
[20]. 
Internet  of  Things  will  become 
increasingly present in the reality of society. 
This  kind  of  ubiquitous  computing  will 
generate huge  amounts  of  data  that  must 
be  analyzed  to  generate  value  for 
individuals,  organizations,  entire  industries 
and ultimately, the society [20].  
The large volume of data produced by 
many  sources  defines  the  plan  of 
governments  and  companies,  focusing  on 
the  implementation  of  smart  metering  by 
improving the use of energy resources and 
efficiency  in  supply  and  consumption. 
Automation  is  present  at  all  levels  of society,  in  the  case  of  IoT  we  can  have smart meters that monitor the activities of patients, seniors or children [21]. 
Other  implications  such  as  privacy 
issues  should  be  taken  into  account, 
especially in home automation and leakage 
of  sensor  data  as  a  form  of  industrial 
espionage [21]. 
Security  issues  are  low  priority  for 
mainly IoT device vendors, and this has led 
to a situation where numerous devices have 
critical security vulnerabilities at their core. 
Therefore,  the  security  and  privacy  of 
location  information  is  often  exposed  to 
attacks [19]. 
The 4
th Industrial Revolution improves 
the global competitiveness and shifts of the 
production  to  the  countries  where  the 
supplier  company  are  expected  [22].    This 
model is named Industry 4.0, and it is based 
on intelligent infrastructures such as smart 
mobility,  the  smart  grid,  smart  cities  and 
smart buildings. All incorporated in the IoT 
concept, in a collaborative network. 
The  increase  of  automation  based  on 
new  technologies  is  the  core  concept  of 
Industry  4.0.  Connectivity  and  inter-part 
interaction, integrated use of machines and 
human  beings  will  make  production 
systems 30% faster and 25% more efficient 
and  raise  product  customization  to  a  new 
scale [22]. 
Industrial processes increasingly adopt 
Information  Technology  (IT),  with  the 
development  of  digital  circuits  since  the 
1970s  [22].  Since  then,  we  watch  a  digital 
transformation in the production forms. 
An  example  of  such  virtual  circuits  is 
the  adoption  of  CPPS  (CyberPhysical 
Production  Systems)  that  are  increasingly 
present.  CPPS  are  online  networks  for 
communication  between  machines,  linking 
mechanical  and  electronic  components. 
RFID technology was an early form of this 
technology,  until  its  evolution  to  the 
concept of IoT [22]. An RFID system, on the 
PART 1:

WORKING IN 2050   9 

 
other hand, usually consists of readers and 
a large population of tags. In addition, each 
tag has a small memory to store its unique 
ID  and  some  other  information,  for 
example,  product  price,  expiration  date, 
personal  information,  and  so  on.  These 
labels  may  be  managed  through  wireless 
network  in  real  time,  among  other 
advantages  over  identification  techniques 
such as magnetic stripe and bar code [23]. 
3. EMPLOYMENT WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY 
CHANGING
 
The  world  faces  the  4th  Industrial 
Revolution which has a widespread impact 
on  society,  affecting  education, 
employment,  and  skills,  requiring  stronger 
partnerships  between  governments, 
educators,  training  providers,  workers  and 
employers  [24].  The  main  drivers  of  this 
revolution  are  artificial  intelligence, 
machine  learning,  nanotechnology,  3D 
printing,  robotics,  biotechnology,  and 
genetics  each  interacting  in  multiple 
directions  and  intensifying  each  other. 
While  new  technologies  are  expected  to 
promote  a  better  society  and  well-being 
they can also represent threats to jobs and 
shall be proactively observed and adapted 
by,  societies,  governments,  corporations, 
and individuals [24].  
In order to meet future job demands, 
there will be an adoption of more flexible 
work  contracts,  modifying  the  traditional 
relationship  between  employees  and 
employers, with the popularization of part-
time jobs and other types of hiring that are 
not common in the business model of large 
companies,  e.g.  crowdsourcing  [25]  [26]. 
Crowdsourcing involves the coordination of 
a crowd (a large group of people online) to 
do autonomously a fraction (small tasks) of 
a large work. Companies use crowdsourcing 
to accomplish their tasks, find solutions to 
problems or gather information [27]. 
In  the  future,  gender  equality  will  be 
natural  and  intrinsic  in  most  societies,  as 
well  as  the  participation  of  aging  people, returning from retirement or even delaying the  exit  from  the  job  market.  These scenarios  tend  to  create  a  more  powerful workforce,  with  a  high  work-life  balance promoted  by  part-time  jobs  and  home-office  enhanced  by  virtual  reality  and augmented reality [24] [28].  
As  expected,  the  global  economy  will 
reduce the countries' borders promoting a 
global  workforce  able  to  be  hired  from 
anywhere in the globe. This is not a recent 
trend but tends to grow and consolidate as 
a solution in a future where automation will 
be widespread in the societies, substituting 
manual and repetitive tasks, and amplifying 
the  creative  economy.  These  trends  will 
require  the  adaptation  of  education  to 
prepare  the  workforce  to  answer  the 
market  necessity  as  soon  as  it  raises,  not 
creating a gap and consequently a massive 
unemployment [29] [30].   
In  conformance  with  previously 
mentioned trends for employment, the way 
how people claim for labor rights tends to 
change,  creating  a  movement  of  self-
organized  independent  groups  in  contrast 
with the traditional trade unions. Given that 
regulation  tends  to  strengthen  employees' 
rights,  collective  agreements  will  become 
increasingly redundant. 
3.1. MY CAREER NO LONGER EXISTS. WHAT 
SHOULD 
I DO NOW?  
There  is  a  dispute  between  the 
technological  unemployment  and  the  job 
displacement thesis [31]. 
Technological  unemployment  can  be 
defined  as  "unemployment  due  to  our 
discovery of means of economizing the use 
of  labor  outrunning  the  pace  at  which  we 
can find new uses for labor" [32]. Showing 
the present strength of this line of thought - 
that has defenders since the First Industrial 
Revolution - Strawn  [33] lists  seven books 
written since 2013 by authors that defend 
the technological unemployment thesis. 
PART 1:

P

The job displacement theory states that 
automation  will  cause  the  extinction  of 
certain careers but also the creation of new 
ones  causing  little  to  no  harm  to 
employment  [34].  Even  if  this  prediction 
seems  more  optimistic  than  the 
technological unemployment, it also has its 
dangers  for  society.  For  the  last  two 
centuries, economists defended that the job 
displacement  theory  have  been  right  but 
there is no economic law guaranteeing that 
most  people  automatically  benefit  from 
technological progress [35]. 
The occupations that are more likely to 
be  computerized  in  the  next  decades  are 
the  ones  with  the  lowest  average  median 
wages  and  the  ones  in  which  we  are  less 
likely  to  find  people  with  a  bachelor's 
degree or better [36]. 
This  trend  should  be  a  concern  for 
society  because  the  people  that  are  more 
likely  to  lose  their  jobs  are  also  the  ones 
with least resources to change careers given 
that  it  requires  enrolling  in  courses  to 
acquire new creative and social skills [36]. 
Another  trend  that  is  likely  to  help  to 
destroy  some  careers  is  the  rise  of  the 
knowledge  economy.  As  the  economy 
moves away from being dominated by the 
processing  of  materials  towards  a  more 
information-intensive production [37] it can 
be expected that the careers related to this 
previous mode of production will no longer 
exist as happened in the past with the move 
from  the  farming  sector  to  the  industrial 
one [34]. 
Wide-spread skill-development policies 
will  be  required  in  the  future  along  with 
some  sort  of  universal  basic  income  that 
would allow  individuals to act as free and 
choosing agents [38]. 
If  the  trend  of  technological 
unemployment  comes  to  fruition,  society 
will have to find ways of coping with higher 
rates  of  unemployment  and  may  face  the 
impossibility  of  maintaining  the  traditional 
work  week  and  hours  which  will  lead  to solutions that  look to reduce the hours  in the work week [33]. 
The  end  of  careers  can  be  an  even 
bigger  issue  if  considered  from  a  more 
philosophical  perspective.  Voltaire  [39] 
writes that "work keeps at bay three great 
evils:  boredom,  vice,  and  need".  The 
solutions  outlined  above  only  address  the 
evil of need, what to do of the other two? 
The  end  of  careers  puts  pressure  on 
humankind to look for other ways of filling 
the void left by the end of work (at least for 
a part of society) with something else that 
gives meaning to life. 
3.2. WILL THE GLOBALIZED WORK 
OVERCOME LOCAL WORK
? 
Globalization  is  not  a  recent 
phenomenon, but it was accelerated by the 
increase of communication and the decline 
of  electronic  devices  prices.  Models  based 
on outsourcing are also not recent, but their 
capillarity,  quality,  and  availability  tend  to 
improve  in  the  future  [40]  [41].  The 
globalization  created  two  trends  on 
markets: the remote worker hired without 
needing  to  migration  and  the  immigrant 
that is hired and displaced from his original 
country to another. 
Remote  working  is  already  a  reality, 
even  on  traditional  enterprises  as  IBM 
where only 42 percent of employees work 
at  IBM  location  [42].  This  internal  remote 
allocation is only recently being adopted by 
big companies, but on startups it's already a 
common  practice.  This  approach  to  team 
formation  allows  the  hiring  of  high-skilled 
workers and, in the future, considering the 
flexibilization  of  traditional  employment 
contracts, a firm will be able to contract a 
part-time employee wherever he is without 
the need of displacing the worker [43] [44].  
The  evolution  of  technology  and 
communication  will  allow  the  use  of  fast 
internet by a feasible price on small cities, 
which  has  a  fraction  of  the  cost  of  big 
metropolis[45]  [26].  This  cheap  and  fast 
Internet will enable a lower cost of life and 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
WORKING IN 2050   11 

 
will  engender  the  improvement  of 
infrastructure  on  small  cities,  proving  a 
fertile ground to a massive urban exodus.  
Local work will be refreshed to provide 
value  on  another  sort  of  occupations, 
mainly motivated by the automation and its 
consequences,  which  will  generate  in  the 
medium term the extinction of manual jobs, 
as  well  as  the  dangerous,  dirty  and  risky 
jobs.  [26]  [46].  Globalization  will  not 
overcome  local  work,  but  will  promote 
modifications on how the work is done. 
Considering the flexibility of where the 
worker  can  be,  as  mentioned  previously, 
centralized offices with hundreds of people 
that  ignore  the  travel  time  of  employees 
tends  to  change.  Distributed  offices  on 
multiple  locations  or  even  co-working 
spaces  will  promote  a  cost  reduction  to 
enterprises,  becoming  an  alternative  to 
central offices located on a fully commercial 
area [26].  
Despite  a  global  population  of 
approximately  six  billion  individuals,  just 
the  minority  is  considered  part  of  the 
developed  global  workforce  [47]  [48].  It  is 
estimated  that  80  percent  of  the  world's 
population  are  at  the  bottom  of  the 
economic pyramid, and live predominantly 
in developing countries [49]. Meanwhile, the 
emerging hypercompetitive global economy 
is increasingly intolerant of any inability to 
keep  pace  with  change,  deliver  less  than 
foremost  performance,  or  continue 
dependencies  on  slow  legacy-based 
systems of workforce preparation. 
Motivated  by  unemployment,  lack  of 
food,  imminence  of  war,  radiation  and 
other  extreme  situations,  a  considerable 
number  of  people  migrate  illegally  to 
neighboring countries [48]. Considering the 
global  warming  and  polar  ice  sheets 
melting,  some  regions  tend  to  disappear 
creating  a  massive  emigration  to  nearby 
countries,  therefore  the  fight  for  jobs  and 
against  climate  change  requires 
complementary  actions,  not  just  to  avoid more environmental refugees [50], but also to help people conquer a better quality of life [51] [28]. 
3.3. WILL I HAVE TO WORK HERE ALL DAY 
LONG
? 
In the past few decades, there was an 
increase in flexible and adaptable contract 
models  which  fostered  the  emergence  of 
part-time jobs and crowdsourcing, enabling 
to the reformulation of the idea of jobs and 
the  relationship  between  employee  and 
employer [25] [26]. 
The  trends  for  the  future  show 
increasing  flexibility  to  workers,  becoming 
possible to have a flexible portfolio of part-
time  jobs  or  casual  jobs  instead  of  one 
regular  traditional  job.  Considering  this 
scenario, virtual reality (VR) and augmented 
reality  (AR)  will  be  used  to  create  an 
immersion  and  amplify  the  sense  of 
collaboration,  allowing  the  worker  to  be 
wherever is suitable for him [46].  
The  increase  in  part-time  jobs  will 
stimulate  entrepreneurship,  in  a  society 
where automation will handle manual jobs 
and creativity will be the human differential 
[46]  [52]  [45].  Currently,  some  nations,  to 
avoid  high  rates  of  unemployment,  are 
promoting a transition from regular to part-
time  jobs,  reducing  the  salary  and 
consequently the final cost to the employer 
[53] [54]. 
The  traditional  family  structure  is 
changing  and  tends  to  promote  more 
gender  equality,  with  an  increasing 
participation  of  women  in  the  domestic 
economy  [24]  [28].  Furthermore,  the 
increase  in  part-time  jobs  and  in  home 
office,  allows  women  to  work  even  during 
pregnancy  or  the  early  years  of  the  baby 
[24].  
Flexible  contracts  and  the  future 
necessity  for  more  skilled  workforce  will 
create  a  new  phenomenon:  the  return  of 
older people to the workforce motivated by 
the interest in helping the society with their 
PART 1:

P
K 
experience  but  also  as  a  financial 
contribution  to  their  retirement  plans  and 
domestic economy [55] [28]. This trend shall 
promote a significant impact on society as 
organizations will be able to keep on being 
competitive  by  having  access  to  a  bigger 
pool of skilled professionals thus reducing 
the  shortage  of  specialists  and  the  impact 
on social security systems [55] [25]. 
Considering  the  advances  on 
Healthcare automation, increase in the use 
of  continuous-health  tracking  devices, 
reduction  of  healthcare  costs  and  human 
mistakes  being  extinguished  due  to 
automation,  life  expectancy  and  the  time 
that an individual will be able to work and 
have  an  active  participation  in  society  will 
increase [56] [45]. 
3.4. HOW ABOUT MY LABOR RIGHTS? 
According  to  the  International  Labor 
Organization  (ILO)  [57], "Non-Standard 
forms  of  Employment    have  become  a 
contemporary  feature  of  labor  markets 
around the world". In South America, 6 out 
of 10 young people who get a job today do 
so in the informal economy [51]. This trend 
is  not  exclusive  to  countries  in 
development; Petrie [58] predicts that 40% 
of the US labor force will be self-employed 
by 2020. 
These new employment types share  a 
common  feature  of  deviating  from  the 
standard  employment  relationship  (work 
that is full-time, indefinite, as well as part of 
a  subordinate  relationship  between  an 
employee  and  an  employer)  and  can  be 
divided into four types [57]: 
1. Temporary:  fixed-term  contracts, 
including  project  or  task-based  contracts; 
seasonal work; casual work, including daily 
work; 
2. Part-time  and  on-call  work: 
normal working hours fewer than full-time 
equivalents;  marginal  part-time 
employment;  on-call  work,  including  zero-
hours  contracts  (no  guarantee  of  a 
minimum wage); 3. Multi-party  employment 
relationship: also  known  as  'dispatch', 
'brokerage'  and  'labor  hire'.  Temporary 
agency work; subcontracted labor; 
4. Disguised  employment  / 
dependent  self-employment: can involve 
masking  the  identity  of  the  employer  by 
hiring the workers through a third party, or 
by  engaging  the  worker  in  a  civil, 
commercial or cooperative contract instead 
of an employment contract and at the same 
time directing and monitoring the working 
activity  in  a  way  that  is  incompatible  with 
the  worker's  independent  status.  Thus, 
workers  are  purposefully  misclassified  as 
independent,  self-employed  workers,  even 
though  they  are,  in  fact,  in  a  subordinate 
employment relationship. 
The  problem  with  some  of  these  NSE 
can be summarized by saying that "there is 
no  more  connection  between  the  worker 
and  the  employer  than  there  might  be 
between a consumer and a particular brand 
of  soap  or  potato  chips" [59].  These  NSE 
pose  great  risks  to  worker's  security, 
particularly  when  they  are  not  voluntary 
[57].  Table  1  summarizes  the  impacts  of 
NSE. 
On-demand economy (or gig economy) 
may represent an opportunity in connected 
and  app-driven  economies  that  could 
produce several benefits for society but this 
cannot happen at the cost of exploiting and 
degrading human dignity at work [60]. That 
said, replacing fixed employments with gigs 
can produce an economic boost, not only by 
allowing a better match of workers to jobs 
but also by freeing the energies of workers 
frustrated with their jobs [59]. 
Given  the  projected  increase  in  these 
NSE and the impacts that are already being 
felt both by employees and by the society, 
we  can  expect  to  see  more  debates  and 
policies concerning the flexibility of worker 
contracts  and  new  worker  classifications. 
McAfee & Brynjolfsson [16] give an example 
of  a  policy  proposed  by  Harris  &  Krueger 
[61] to create a new "independent worker" 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK

designation which would not be eligible for 
overtime pay or unemployment insurance. 
However,  they  would  enjoy  the  protection 
of federal antidiscrimination statutes, have 
the  right  to  organize,  and  tax  withholding 
[61].  Their  employers,  whether  online  or 
offline,  would  make  payroll  tax 
contributions [61]. 
 We  should  not  expect  gigs  to  replace 
traditional employments, even so the rise of 
the gig economy presents an opportunity to 
reconsider the social policy  [59]. Following 
this  line  of  thought,    two  issues  that  are 
likely to be of great concern for our society 
in the future must be considered [60]. The 
first one relates to the need to search for 
new sources of essential worker protection measures  (e.g.  vacation  pay)  traditionally guaranteed  to  ordinary  employees.  The erosion  of  such  rights  might  threaten welfare  in  countries  where  the  welfare system  is  strictly  connected  to  a  stable employment  contract.  The  second  one  is that  labor  regulations  must  protect  both clients  and  workers,  the  rules  created  to protect  workers'  rights  cannot  affect  the dynamic  potential  of  "collaborative  forces" 
in the new economy. 
3.5. WILL TRADE UNIONS LOSE THEIR 
IMPORTANCE
? 
The trends discussed in the sections 3.2 
and  3.4,  namely  the  intensification  of 
globalization  and  increase  in  NSE,  make  it 





Table 1. Summary of impacts of NSE, based on ILO [57]. 
Impact on Description 
Employment 
security 
The greater the incidence of temporary employment in the country, 
the greater the likelihood that workers will transit between NSE and 
unemployment, with the possibility of transitioning to better jobs less 
likely. 
Earnings 
Wages  tend  to  be  substantially  lower  for  workers  in  NSE  when 
compared to those in standard employment. 
Working hours 
Working  hours  are  more  uncertain  for  workers  in  NSE  resulting  in 
lower work-life balance. 
Occupational 
security and health
 Injury rates are higher among workers in NSE. 
Social security 
Social  security  coverage  law  sometimes  excludes  NSE 
workers  and, 
when  they  are  covered,  their  employment  arrangements  tend  to 
result in worse benefits. 
Training 
Workers in NSE are less likely to receive on-the-
job training, which can 
have  negative  repercussions  on  career  development,  especially  for 
young workers. 
Representation and 
other fundamental 
rights at work Workers  in  NSE  may  lack 
access  to  freedom  of  association  and 
collective bargaining rights either for legal reasons or because of their 
more tenuous attachment to the workplace. They may also face other 
violations of their fundamental rights at work, including discrimination 
and forced labor. 
Firms 
Firms that rely heavily on NSE need to adapt their human resource 
strategies from training and development of in-house employees to 
identifying  the  sets  of  skills  that  the  firm  needs  to  buy  from  the 
market. An over-reliance on NSE can lead to a gradual erosion of firm-
specific  skills  in  the  organization,  limiting  its  ability  to  respond  to 
changing market demand. 
Labor markets and 
society 
Widespread  use  of  NSE  may  reinforce  labor  market  segmentation, 
leading to a greater volatility in employment with consequences for 
economic stability.

harder  for  workers  on  the  new  NSE  to 
organize  and  to  form  unions. 
Crowdworkers,  for  instance,  are  facing  a 
challenging  goal  due  to  their  geographical 
distribution that makes it harder to create 
solidarity  between  the  workers  in  this 
particular category [60]. On the other side, 
the  very  spread  and  growth  of  some 
companies in the gig economy could make 
it easier for worker's organizations to aim at 
them ( i.e. by increasing vertical integration 
in  some  traditionally  highly  fragmented 
sectors such as car-hailing services) [62]. 
The  labor  movement  survived  recent 
changes  in  economy  in  two  ways,  and 
maybe  these  practices  can  be  used  in  the 
future.  The  first  one  involves  using  the 
same technology that is partly responsible 
for the creation of some of the new NSE and 
for  the  intensification  of  globalization  to 
help workers organize. This is already being 
done as shown by the following examples.  
App-Based Drivers Association
1 (ABDA) is a 
group from Seattle (United States) that aims 
to give a voice to app-based (e.g. Uber, Lyft) 
drivers.  This  association  allows  new 
members to join it by filling an online form 
on  their  website.  This  group  had  a  major 
win in 2015 when a law was passed by the 
city  of  Seattle  allowing  the  car-haling  app 
drivers  to  form  unions  [60]  [62]. 
Turkopticon
2 is an initiative, with more than 
10  years,  created  by  the  University  of 
California  San  Diego  that  allows  Amazon 
Mechanical Turk (AMT) workers to evaluate 
their Human Intelligence Tasks. This can be 
done  by  using  either  their  Chrome  or 
Firefox  add-on  [60]  [62].  Dynamo
3 is 
another  type  of  worker  organization  that 
focuses on AMT. It works as a wiki for the 
community  of  AMT  workers  in  which  they 
can create campaigns and join discussions 
to improve their working conditions [60]. 
The second way to keep unions alive in 
the  future  of  work  is  looking  for  support 
                                                             
1 http://www.abdaseattle.org 2 http://turkopticon.ucsd.edu 3 http://www.wearedynamo.org 
from  traditional  unions  and  other  social 
actors.  Unions  can  see workers  in the on-
demand  economy  as  a  huge  pool  of  new 
members [60]. One case of the association 
of traditional unions with workers on NSE is 
the  FairCrowdWork  Watch4 -  which  was 
created  by  the  IG  Metall  (dominant 
metalworkers'  union  in  Germany)  -  that 
allows workers to rate platforms, compare 
their payment with others and receive legal 
advisory  [62].  Another  example  of  digital 
workers  being  supported  by  traditional 
unions  was  the  strike  organized  by  the 
Huffington Post collaborators after the site 
was sold to AOL for over US$ 300 million by 
its  owner,  Arianna  Huffington,  leaving  the 
workers empty-handed. The movement was 
supported by the Newspaper Guild and by 
the  National  Writers  Union -  both 
traditional riters' unions. The group took its 
fight  to the  court demanding that  Arianna 
paid them US$ 105 million [63].  
The  Crowdsourcing  Verband
5 -  a 
German  association  that  brings  together 
crowds,  companies,  and  experts -  is  an 
example of a non-union social actor that is 
helping to improve working conditions for a 
group  of  new  workers  in  NSEs.  They  are 
doing  this  by  creating  a  code  of  conduct 
that  aims  to  be  a "guideline  for  a 
prosperous  and  fair  cooperation  between 
companies, clients, and crowdworkers" [62]. 
Given  the  plurality  of  examples  of 
worker's organizations and the importance 
of unionization for workers in the future, it 
can be expected that unions will continue to 
exist. Besides, another trend that can be put 
forward  is  the  increasing  application  of 
technology  to  help  the  organization  of 
workers  geographically  dispersed.  These 
trends  show  that  we  will  probably  see  a 
change in the nature of unions due to the 
very change of the workers that constitute 
them  but  not  a  loss  of  their  importance 
since  the  future  of  employment  holds

similar challenges to those faced by workers 
in the past [64]. 
4. EDUCATION WILL NEED TO BE 
UPDATED
 
With the big changes coming to work, 
education  will  need  to  adapt  using 
advancements in technology to achieve this 
change. As work becomes more and more 
demanding of the skilled workforce with a 
deep  knowledge  of  their  skills,  the 
education  system  will  need  to  train  new, 
more specialized workers, with some forms 
of  work  ceasing  to  exist  and  new  jobs 
emerging [44].  
Changes  in  education  are  usually 
reactive: there is a tendency to continue the 
process of training workers to (soon-to-be) 
old  jobs  in  order  to  serve  current  job 
market,  creating  a  gap  for  the  new  ones. 
The world will need to adapt to a new way 
of  teaching  so  that  people's  competences 
are not outdated and lose job opportunities  
[44]. This is a major change in how we feel 
about work today, when an individual study 
during his youth and then chooses a career 
that tends to be kept the same during the 
life. In the future, we will have to keep on 
learning  throughout  life  to  adapt  to 
different jobs. As it can be seen, the social 
impacts of this change can be very serious if 
we do not adapt in time [44]. 
Another  important  trend  is  how  work 
will require less time from people [44], thus 
leaving them with more time to study and 
learn  new  skills,  reinforcing  the  idea  that 
people will be able to learn new skills while 
working.  In  addition,  this  means  that 
education  will  need  to  keep  updated  on 
new  job  tendencies  to  be  able  to  train 
workers to take on these new jobs. With the 
possible changes in the model of education 
we'll see a change in what teachers do, we 
might  be  seeing  them  turning  from  
knowledge providers to guides through the 
massive  amount  of  available  knowledge 
[44].  As  free  information  becomes  more 
prevalent in society, we might see teachers replaced by MOOCs if people become more autodidact. 
With these many changes and an ever 
increasing  freedom  it's  easy  to  see 
everything going out of control, thus comes 
the government, that might be responsible 
for  applying  incentives  to  these  changes 
and  also  inspecting  them  to  guarantee 
quality and fulfillment [65]. The government 
will then be key in keeping the education up 
to  date  with  the  new  skills  needed  by 
workers, keeping those responsible for the 
education in close contact with those who 
hire  the  workforce;  doing  so  will  maintain 
attunement  in  creating  new  jobs  and 
fulfilling them. With the government playing 
a  role  in  education  and  the  race  of 
knowledge-based  workforce  [66],  another 
possibility  is  to  see  investments  in 
development of intelligence through drugs, 
genetics, viruses [65]. 
4.1. DO WE NEED NEW SKILLS? 
The  increasing  use  of  technology  is 
transforming  industries  and  business 
models, changing the skills that employees 
need  and  reducing  the  life  cycle  of 
employees'  skill  sets [24].  This  means  that 
people  will  have  to  adapt  quickly  to 
different  skills  to  supply  the  needs  of  the 
labor  market  [67].  For  example, 
technologies such as robotics and machine 
learning  automate  specific  tasks  of  jobs, 
allowing workers to focus on more complex 
tasks that might require different skills [24]. 
As  it  can  be  seen,  due  to  automation, 
people  will  spend  more time  learning and 
will need education to transition to a new 
careers [68].  
The  new  types  of  jobs  require  high 
skilled workers [67]. Higher level skills lead 
to  innovation  and  entrepreneurship,  bring 
flexibility  and  adaptability  [69],  and  thus, 
usually  require  higher  level  qualifications 
[67]. Higher skills are particularly needed to 
Science,  Technology,  Engineering,  and 
Mathematics (STEM) subjects, which plays a 
fundamental role in the  economic success 
of a country  [69]. Building such high skills 
PART 1:

P
K 
requires  an  investment  in  education  of 
years. 
The future worker will need a different 
set of skills when compared to the present 
ones: they need more cognitive skills, such 
as critical thinking and non-routine problem 
solving;  interpersonal  skills,  such  as 
presentation  skills  and  conflict  resolution; 
and intrapersonal skills, such as adaptability 
and self-development [70]. Jobs intensive in 
social and creative skills have a low risk of 
automation  [67].  Thus,  six  important  skills 
that  students  can  develop  are: 
collaboration,  knowledge  construction, 
skilled communication, self-regulation, real-
world  problem-solving,  and  use  of 
information and communication technology 
for learning [71].  
The rise in the demand of highly skilled 
workers  tends  to  occur  simultaneously  to 
the rise in the demand of lower level jobs, 
especially in services - jobs requiring low or 
no skills are projected to grow [69].  Literacy 
and  numeracy  are  fundamental  skills  [72], 
and team working and communication are 
important skills for most jobs [69]. 
4.2. HOW WILL KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE 
WORK CHANGE THE 
EDUCATION? 
One of the biggest trends of the future 
of work is how it'll become more knowledge 
focused  [44].  As  commented  earlier,  with 
many  jobs  becoming  automated,  the  jobs 
that  remain  will  be  knowledge-intensive, 
harder to automate. Then we face ourselves 
with  the  question  of  how  to  achieve  this 
greater  knowledge  demanded  for  those 
new jobs, or else how to make the majority 
of the population knowledgeable enough to 
occupy these future jobs? 
Another  trending  change  in  education 
is the personalization of the education [73] 
[74].  Researchers  consulted  a  group  of 
specialists,  and  78%  of  them  agree  that 
education  "will  have  personalized  learning 
plans  that  take  into  account  individual 
needs,  interests  and  preferences" [75]. 
Personalization  might  be  one  main  driver for achieving more deepness in knowledge, by  allowing  the  students  to  use  most  of their time learning a selected  set of skills, therefore, providing a better understanding. This better understanding is later converted into  better  competitiveness  in  knowledge-focused jobs.   
Another  subject  is  that  of  how  will 
advancements  in  technology  affect 
education  and  maybe  help  with  these 
needed  changes.  A  new  technology  that 
could  be  able  to  help  with  the 
personalization of education is the Massive 
Open Online Courses (MOOCs) [74] [66] [76] 
and the digital school in which they will be 
the main providers of the learning process. 
New  Information  and  Communication 
Technologies might be of great importance 
in future education [77], 
One  possible  way  of  addressing  the 
problem of improving education is to look 
at  the  knowledge  management  inside 
educational  organizations  [78].  While  this 
may look like a short-term solution, it may 
prove  invaluable  in  the  creation  of  the 
education of the future, as the way we pass 
on  knowledge  to  others  change,  we  will 
need  to  know  we  are  changing  it  in  an 
effective  way.  Studies  in  the  knowledge 
management area can play a main role in 
guaranteeing that we do not stray from the 
effectiveness on education. 
A  trend  that  might  be  of  great 
importance to create a knowledge centered 
education  is  Open  Access  [66].  Sharing 
research  to  everyone  provides  easy  and 
free  access  to  new  knowledge.  Students - 
who already are or will be workers - benefit 
from this knowledge, and they are likely to 
keep themselves updated for life. Therefore, 
education  organizations  will  need  to 
consider this and teach students about this 
possibility.  We  also  see  this  making  an 
impact  in  another  problem  of  the  future 
workforce, which is the need to change your 
knowledge  area  many  times  during  your 
lifetime,  with  Open  Access  everyone  may 
learn of the newest discoveries as they are 
PART 1:  
K

WORKING IN 2050   17 

 
made, and then might be readier to change 
when needed. 
4.3. WILL SELF-EMPLOYMENT SAVE THE 
WORLD
? 
The  labor  market  has  a  significant 
presence of self-employed workers - small 
traders,  doctors,  basic  manufacturers, 
lawyers,  freelance  handymen,  smallholder 
farmers.  Self-employment  is  not  only  a 
solution for individuals who have not found 
job opportunities, but is also a chance for 
individuals searching for a different career 
path  [79].  As  a  recent  global  trend  in 
working practice, it is an option followed by 
many  workers -  according  to  OECD,  self-
employment rates  were on average  15.4% 
in  2014,  but  data  for  individual  countries 
show notable disparity, varying from under 
7%  in  the  United  States  to  over  30%  in 
Greece, Mexico and Turkey [80], as shown 
in  Figure  1.  These  workers  have  different 
ages,  races,  physical  and  personality 
characteristics, and educational skills. 
The collaborative  economy  (or  "gig 
economy")  allows  the  sharing  of  good, 
space  and  services  [81].  Examples  for  this 
case are private transport services, such as 
Uber  and  Cabify,  and  rent-sharing  rooms such as Airbnb.  We identified contradictory trends -  i.e.,  the  collaborative  economy 
depends  on  the  economic  growth.  In  a 
scenario of economic growth and declining 
unemployment,  the  collaborative  economy 
complements the worker's monthly income. 
However,  in  a  scenario  of  unfavorable 
economic  or  labor  conditions  [82],  the 
collaborative  economy  becomes  the  only 
possible option for income. 
As an agent to support these changes, 
we  are  experiencing  now  a  rich  digital 
educational  landscape,  where  can  be 
included  massive  online  resources 
produced  for  websites  like  YouTube
6, 
Udemy
7 or Udacity8 that enable learners to 
access information directly and on-demand, 
allowing learners and teachers to find each 
other  outside  formal  educational  methods 
[83].  Such  websites  have  the  power  to 
increase  educational  training  to  self-
employees,  extends  the  possibilities  of 
building  relationships  between  teachers 
and  learners,  opening  potential  for 
everyone  to teach  for  the  new  "always-
online" generations.

However,  it  does  not  reduce  the 
importance  of  traditional  self-employment 
governmental  programs  that  provide 
business  training,  technical  support,  and 
financial  assistance,  giving  to  freelancer 
workers  a  better  understanding  of  all 
aspects  of  starting  and  operating  a  new 
business  [84].  This  training  is  an  effective 
program for assisting unemployed workers 
interested in self-employment to start their 
own  business,  remain  self-employed,  and 
avoid unemployment for long periods [84]. 
4.4. WILL EVERYONE RECEIVE ADVANCED 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING? 
As  a  part  of  these  new,  big  changes, 
workers in the future will shift from having 
generalist ability to having specialist ability 
[44], at the higher levels of knowledge or at 
lower  ones.  As  technology  advances, 
educated workers tend to benefit more and 
those less educated tend to have their jobs 
automated  first  [70].  For  instance,  the 
manufacturing  industry  went  from 
craftsmanship  to  the  factory  system, 
changing  dynamically  from  mechanized 
powered systems to the present-day trend 
towards  application  of  advanced 
manufacturing  technology  (computerized 
design,  planning,  and  manufacturing  tools 
such  as  CAD,  CAM  and  MRP).  Parallel  to 
these  modifications  in  the  production 
organization  and  technologies  there  have 
been dramatic changes in the skills required 
of  the  human  component  of  this  work 
system [85]. 
In  fact,  advanced  education  is  more 
cost-effective for the employer: it is better 
to  send  employees  outside  to  train 
specialized  skills  as  needed,  than 
permanently hire in-house trainers [86].  
Important  innovations  are  in  progress 
and  tend  to  become  widely  accessible, 
bringing the opportunity to get a good job, 
possibly  with  a  higher  starting  income,  as 
some  short-term  higher  education 
credentials are worth as much as long-term 
ones  [87].  Among  these  innovations  we highlight the massive online training tools, where  it  is  possible  to  teach  and  train  a large  number  of  workers  on-demand, outside  formal  educational  methods  [83], and  short-term  higher  education  courses like associate's degrees in USA, whose main difference to traditional bachelor's degree is in  the  proposal:  a  vocational  education, focused  on  a  rapid  insertion  in  the  labor market [88].  
Despite  all  this  progress,  advanced 
education will not reach a large part of the 
population in the near future. While many 
countries have enrolled upwards of 50% of 
the  age  cohort  attending  post-secondary 
education  during  the  last  few  decades, 
many  countries  still  enroll  only  a  small 
percentage -  poorer  nations  are  likely  to 
enroll  fewer  students  than  wealthier 
nations. Additionally, even when enrollment 
has expanded, participation has rarely been 
representative  of  the  society  as  a  whole: 
within  most  nations,  access  to  higher 
education  is  still  the  privilege  of  specific 
segments of society [89]. 
5. WE ARE SLOWLY MOVING TO A SOCIAL 
WELFARE STATE
 
The  Welfare  State  is  the  type  of  state 
organization  that  seeks  to  provide  society 
with  basic  public  services  and  security, 
guaranteeing  collective  rights  so  that 
extreme economic and social differences do 
not  occur  between  individuals.  The 
discussion  on  social  welfare  involves  a 
reflection on whether social policies should 
be directed or universal involving only the 
poor  or  including  all  people  [90].  The 
provision  of  basic  health,  education  and 
security in a broad and unrestricted manner 
are  common  in  this  type  of  organization. 
Intervention in labor relations is also part of 
the scope of the welfare state.  
The  technological  progress  until  2050 
will  modify  the  work  demand  in 
organizations  in  an  extreme  way.  The 
reduction  of  the  jobs  available  eventually 
reduces  the  population  purchasing  power. 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
WORKING IN 2050   19 

 
Consumption  and  production  of 
information  are  being  altered,  with 
automation and learning [91]. 
This  new  service-based  relationship 
creates a set of human, social, scientific and 
environmental  complexities,  including  how 
people live, move, receive and deliver tasks 
and  services  on  digital  platforms. 
Servitization, Informatization, Digitalization, 
and  Creativization  will  be  new  digital 
services [92]. 
Public  services  that  provide  social 
welfare as services for digital cities will be 
based  on  jointly  resource-conscious, 
facilitating  innovation  and  creativity, 
functioning as a service economy [93].  
In fact, this transition from traditional 
models  to  more  transparent  and  agile 
models  is  a  symptom  that  covers  many 
areas from software development to service 
exchanges and micro-pay according to the 
time you spend running a given demand. In 
addition,  the  idea  of  creative  cities  is  also 
related  to  an  agenda  and  progressive 
planning including aspects of sustainability 
and social inclusion [94].  
New  productive  arrangements  have 
been tested, mainly due to the relationship 
between supply and demand. The forms of 
production of various products have caused 
significant  impacts  within  the  market  and 
the  relations  between  employers  and 
employees  seem  saturated  by  hierarchical 
models of decision-making, high taxes and 
ineffective results.  
Collaborative  practice  communities, 
such  as  free  software  communities, 
associated  with  universities,  hackerspaces, 
small  businesses  and  other  productive 
arrangements, are experimenting with and 
applying  methodologies  that  combine  art 
and fast deliveries for the development of 
software projects. As the artisan manifesto
9 
suggests  of  software,  presenting  different 
                                                             
9 http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org 
functioning  of  large  software  companies 
and showing a new way of building software 
where  creativity,  customer  focus,  quality 
and agility are fundamental values. 
In  the  other  hand,  companies  are 
moving to become Learning Organizations. 
Such organizations not only create, acquire, 
cultivate  and  transfer  knowledge,  but  also 
to  modify  people  and  organizations  based 
on  the  motivations  of  new  knowledge, 
insights and brainstorming to improve task 
engagement [95]. 
Some developed countries in Europe began 
to  hold  debates  on  the  notion  of  "social 
investment"  from  an  agenda  of  the 
European  Union  in  the  early  2000s.  The 
perspective of social investment intends to 
go  beyond  simply  reinforcing  policies  and 
strategies  in  relation  to  the  labor  market 
and highlighting the return of care and early 
education,  driven  by  many  academic  and 
policy-driven  contributions.  The  social 
investment  paradigm  can  be  seen  as  the 
ideal  institutional  structure  for  the  state, 
which  generates  reform  efforts  in  the 
current  structures  and  policies  through  a 
social  investment  strategy  for  the  welfare 
state  [96].  States  can  manage  these 
resources  in  order  to  develop  universal 
basic  income  programs  adapted  to  theirs 
society needs. 
The  answers  should  be  made  taking 
into consideration what kind of game exists 
between the State and the Citizen and how 
will be the behavior of these players. This 
allows us to design important scenarios at 
the end of the analysis.  
5.1. WILL WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR 
DEFINITION OF OLD
?  
As  we  have  seen  previously, 
technological  progress  will  change  the 
relationship  with  work.  In  health, 
technology will promote an increase in the 
quality of the diagnoses and improvement 
of  the  quality  of  life  of  the  people.  The 
population  is  getting  proportionally  older 
[80],  as  shown  in  Figure  2.  With  this, 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
20 WORKING IN 2050 

P
K 
people's  productive  age  will  get  larger, 
causing  an  increase  in  the  economically 
active  population.  Thus,  longer  lives  imply 
changes  in  pension  systems,  as  well  as 
workers  going  beyond  the  normal 
retirement age for better pension. 
The  delayed  retirement  is  a 
phenomenon  in  which  elderly  population 
keeps their labor force participation. This is 
a  recent  phenomenon  and  is  more 
noticeable  in  high-income  workers  and  in 
less  physically  demanding  occupations. 
Workers  whom  delay  the  retirement  also 
may delay claiming Social Security benefits 
[97].  
In general, rules for eligibility to retire 
and claiming a pension benefit are complex 
and  vary  according  to  each  government 
objectives. According to OECD [98], in 2014, 
the average normal pension age was equal 
to  64.0  years  for  men  and  63.1  years  for 
women, assuming labor market entry at age 
20. The normal pension ages varies from 58 
(women in Turkey) to 67 (Norway). In 11 out 
of the 34 OECD countries, the pension ages 
differ between men and women.  
The OECD predicts for 2054 an increase 
in  the  average  normal  retirement  age,  in 
more  countries  to  set  the  normal 
retirement age to above 65 years and in the 
reduction in the retirement age gender gaps 
[98]. 
In  the  U.S.,  changes  in  Social  Security 
rules  have  been  encouraging  workers  to 
delay the full exit from the workforce. Using 
Current  Population  Survey  (CPS)  data, Bosworth  et  al.  [97]  show  that  the  labor force participation for men over age 60 has a  slowly  falling  pattern.  This  pattern reversed In the 1990s, indicating that older men have been delaying retirement.  
5.2. ARE WE ENTERING IN THE EQUALITY 
ERA
? 
A  market  economy  based  on  private 
property left to itself has powerful forces of 
convergence (such as diffusion of skills) and 
of divergence. The main divergence force is 
the inequality between the rate of return on 
capital  and  the  rate  of  growth  of  income 
and  output.  Projections  show  that  this 
inequality tends to increase in the future as 
depicted in Figure 3. This trend has serious 
negative  consequences  for  wealth 
distribution  as  wealth  previously 
accumulated grows faster than output and 
wages meaning that entrepreneurs tend to 
become rentiers increasingly dominant over 
those  without  properties  but  their  labor 
[99]. 
Several  factors  impact  the  rate  of 
return on capital and the rate of growth of 
income and output, one is the increase in 
gender equality. For instance, the changes 
to  inheritance  law  that  have  been  made 
throughout  history  that  guarantee  a  more 
equal  distribution  both  between 
primogenitors  and  younger  children  and 
between men and women tend to keep the 
pace  of  growth  of  the  rate  of  return  on 
capital
 slower than otherwise over time. An 
increase  in  the  participation  of  women  in 
the economy also tends to give them more 
political power to demand a better work-life 


Figure 2. Elderly population, as a percentage of total population [80]. 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
WORKING IN 2050   21 

 
balance  and  to  promote  human  capital 
investments  thus  increasing  the  rate  of 
growth of income and output. In summary, 
if the trend in increase of gender equality 
sustains  itself  over  the  next  decades,  a 
reduction  in  the  rate  of  increase  of 
economic inequality can be expected [100].  
Gender  equality  itself  has  been 
improving over the last decades but there is 
still  a  lot  to  be  done  for  women  rights  in 
several countries with some critical cases as 
some countries in North Africa and Middle 
East. As shown by Figure 4, the gender gap 
has  been  slowly  reducing  with  subindexes 
as  health  and  education  reaching  values 
close to 1 (equality) but the economic and 
political  subindexes  are  still  far  from 
equality. Considering the current trend, the 
gender  gap  would  only  close  in  83  years 
[101].  Discrimination  towards  women 
happens throughout their lives, sometimes 
even before birth as some parents prefer to 
have a son rather than a daughter leading 
to strategies such as sex-selective abortions. 
It  also  happens  intra-household  via 
selective  resource  allocation  (parents  tend 
to invest more in the education of their son) 
and in the society (i.e. lower participation in 
paid work than men, lower wages than men 
for same positions) [102].  
What  about  the  role  of  technology  in 
the  economic  equality?  Some  researchers 
defend that the exponential change in the 
technology  that  sustains  the  economic system  is  the  main  driver  behind  the growing  inequality.  Digital  technology  acts as a catalyzer of the economic payoff to the winners  in  our  modern  economy  as  the others  become  increasingly  dispensable and  receive  fewer  resources.  The  winners are those who accumulated the right capital assets,  either  nonhuman  (e.g.  equipment, real estate and financial  assets) or human (e.g. training, experience and skills), or the superstars  among  us  that  have  special talents (or luck) (e.g. famous soccer players, singers and CEOs) [103]. We cannot speak of inequality  without  considering  the  racial inequality. If we take the United States as an  example,  Native,  African  and  Latin Americans  have  a  Human  Development Index  value  lower  than  that  of  Asian  and White  Americans.  Taking  the  inequality between  White/Asian  and  African Americans,  the  difference  between  the value of several social indicators such as life expectancy, wages, education, employment and incarceration show a startling disparity among these racial groups [102]. Some  advances  have  been  made  in reducing  racial  inequality.  In  the  US,  for instance, the white-black gap in high school completion  rates  has  been  reduced. Meanwhile, other indicators show that little change  or  even  a  worsening  of  the inequality.  This  is  clear  in  the  case  of household  income:  in  1967,  the  median adjusted income for households headed by whites was US$ 44,700 and by blacks was 



 Figure 3. After tax rate of return on capital vs growth rate at the world level, until 2100 [99].

US$ 24,700; 2014 data shows that this gap 
has widened as the first group income went 
up to US$ 71,300 while the second raised to 
US$ 43,300 [104]. 
 
Figure 4: Global Gender Gap Index and 
subindexes [101].  
Another minority that has been fighting 
for  its  rights  is  the  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual, 
transgender  and  intersex  (LGBTI).  Since sexual orientation is still a taboo theme in several  countries  there  is  not  much  data about  it  making  evidence-based policymaking very hard. Still, what is known about this subject shows a bleak picture as only  ten  countries  grant  equal constitutional rights to the LGBTI group and 73 countries consider same-sex sexual acts illegal  from  which  in  13  these  acts  are punishable by death. These facts show that there  is  still  much  to  be  done  for  LGBTI rights before we can call our society equal. Antidiscrimination laws provide a powerful tool  in  making  people's  attitudes  towards the  LGBTI  community  more  tolerant  as Figure 5 shows [102].  
5.3. IS UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME A 
SOLUTION
?  
Universal  Basic  Income  (UBI)  can  be 
defined  as  an  income  paid  by  a  political 
community  to  all  its  members  on  an 
individual  basis,  without  the  need  for 
means  or  labor  requirements  [105].  This 
concept  is  also  known  as  Unconditional 
Basic  Income  [106].  For  McGahey  [107], 
social  welfare  states  face  challenges  of 
economic  growth  and  employment, 
consequences  arising  from  rising  costs  of 
benefits,  demographic  changes  and  job 
losses  caused  by  information  technology 
and  computerization.  Such  a  combination 
pressures societies to explore new ways of 
offering welfare benefits, or building a new 




 
Figure 5. Advances in tolerance as countries establish antidiscrimination laws [102]. 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
WORKING IN 2050   23 

 
outlet for this problem. 
Faced  with  this  scenario,  McGahey 
suggests  exists  a  path  towards  the 
introduction of a UBI as a floor to provide a 
basic level of subsistence as a complement 
to existing policies of the welfare state, or in 
some cases as a substitute for the welfare 
state [107].  
Esping-Andersen  advocates  a 
classification  into  three  categories  of  care 
states:  Liberal;  Conservative  or  Corporatist 
and  Social  Democrat  [108].  Thinking  of 
forms of regimes, implemented by nations, 
UBI  would  play  out  differently  in  each  of 
these regimes, and in relation to the diverse 
set of existing policies in each [107].  
In the other hand, the Institute for the 
Future
10 understands  that  Universal  Basic 
Assets (UBA) is a fairer way of challenging 
inequality.  The  UBA  is  a  core  set  of 
resources  that  everyone  should  have, 
including  housing,  education,  healthcare 
and  financial  security  and  has  been 
proposed  as  a  way  to  avoid  economic 
disasters  by  properly  assessing  and 
distributing  our  resources  to  meet  the 
needs of each person. It can be seen as an 
evolution  of  the  UBI  concept,  which  gives 
each citizen a fixed amount of guaranteed 
money, regardless of how much they earn 
[109]. 
Recent  UBI  experiments  include 
Finland, in which 2,000 unemployed people 
between the ages of 25 and 58 will receive a 
basic income of €560 a month for two years 
[110];  and  Ontario  (Canada),  in  which 
approximately  4,000  people  will  receive  a 
complementary  basic  income  up  to  C$ 
16,989  per  year  (C$  24,027  for  couples) - 
while keeping other previous benefits [111].

UBI  proposal  of  CHF  2,500  monthly  for

6. THE ECONOMY WILL GROW FASTER 
The  economy  in  2050  will  be  highly 
influenced  by  demographic  changes  that 
are  occurring  right  now.  The  world 
population  is  currently  about  7.6  billion 
people  and,  by  2050,  can  reach  about  10 
billion  people  distributed  across  the  five 
continents  [113].  This  increase  in  the 
world's  population  will  represent  a 
challenge  to  societies  as    hundreds  of 
millions  of  jobs  will  have  to  be  created 
[113].  
Following the demographic tendencies, 
a phenomenon called the "Rise of The Rest" 
is  predicted  by  some  studies  [114]  [115]. 
This  phenomenon  describes  the  shifting 
Gross  Domestic  Product  (GPD)  from 
developed  countries  to  developing  ones. 
Today, we already see the global economic 
activity shifting from the G7 to the G20, this 
means  that  developing  countries  are 
increasing at a larger rate their technology, 
capital and people [114] [115]. 
Countries  like  Brazil,  China,  India, 
Indonesia  and  Mexico  are  likely  to  grow 
their  GDP  an  average  of  three  to  four 
percent  per  year  [115].  Mexico  and 
Indonesia  are  likely  to  be  economically 
larger  in  terms  of  GDP  than  the  United 
Kingdom  and  France  while  Pakistan  and 
Egypt could overtake Italy and Canada on a 
Purchasing  Power  Parity  (PPP)  basis.  In 
terms  of  growth  per  year,  Vietnam,  India 
and Bangladesh can be the fastest growing 
economies  from  now  to  2050.  Figure  6 
shows  the  projected  average  GPD  growth 
from 2016 until 2050.  
The economic change of industries and 
manufacturing  will  progressively  bring 
industrial  services  in  retention,  education, 
social  welfare,  business  and  financial 
services. The emergence of service systems 
could be characterized by the low-paid low-
skill manual job, with wage proportional to 
the  production,  especially  in  the  private 
sector [92].

The development of emerging markets 
will  create  many  business  opportunities. 
These  opportunities  will  arise  as  these 
countries  progress  into  industries  and 
engage  the  world  with  their  growing 
population.  Even  on  2050,  the  population 
from developing countries will be younger 
than the ones in developed countries [115]. 
On  developed  countries,  population 
ageing distribution is shifting towards older 
ages.  In  these  countries,  birth  control 
methods are helping to reduce the number 
of born children and the elderly population 
is living even more because of the advances 
in technology. On developing countries, the 
effects  of  the  population  growth  problem 
are  much  harder  to  observe,  because  this 
change  is  happening  at  a  slower  pace.  As 
people  live  longer,  they  will  have  to 
continue  working  to  make  the  pension 
schemes  affordable  and  this  will  probably 
cause  some  negative  effect  on  youth 
employment. 
The number of people in the cities will 
also grow, for two main reasons. First, the 
total  population  on  Earth  is  growing,  and 
second,  people  living  on  rural  areas  are 
migrating  to  urban  areas -  large  and 
medium  cities.  By  2050,  86%  of  the 
developed countries'  population,  and  64% of the developing countries' population will 
be  urbanized.  This  behavior  shows  some 
negatives and positives trends, urbanization 
may  cause  unplanned  growth  of  cities, 
health  hazards  caused  by  air  and  water 
pollution and unemployment. On the other 
hand,  urbanization  can  bring  reduction  to 
expenses  on  transports,  education  and 
create diversity [113]. 
By 2050, part of the workforce will be 
automated  to  better  suit  the  new  world 
market. Tasks like translation, legal research 
and  low  level  journalism  will  be  done  by 
machines [115]. 
Most of the difficulties for automation 
today are the areas where the income wage 
is already low. For instance, areas such as 
fast  food,  retail  and  telemarketing  keep 
automation at bay because of the prices of 
the automation equipment [116]. However, 
the technology will become cheaper and the 
tradeoff will make sense.  Table 2 shows the 
probability of automation of a set of jobs in 
the next decades [36].  
The  changes  in  work  and  technology 
derive another tendency for the future, the 
inequality [113] [116]. There are many types 
of  inequality,  like  of  rights,  access, 
participation and protection. Some of them 
are  widespread  across  the  countries  and 



 
Figure 6. Projected average real GDP growth 2016-2050, from [115]. 
 
PART 1:

WORKING IN 2050   25 

 
others are more likely to be seen on non-
democratic countries.  
 Income  inequality  is  easy  to  perceive 
in  the  future  of  automation.  Fewer  jobs, 
combined  with  the  higher  skill  level 
required  for  the  existing  ones,  reduce  the 
space for the "average worker". Also, while 
some  countries  are  rapidly  growing,  some 
of  them  are  not  growing  at  all,  increasing 
the  gap  between  developed  and 
underdeveloped countries [116]. 
Inequality  has  significant  implications 
on the macroeconomic stability on 2050 as 
it  tends  to  concentrate  the  power  in  the 
hands  of  the  few.  Inequality  can  lead  to 
suboptimal use of human resources, cause 
investment  reduction,  and  political  and 
economic instability [116]. 6.1. IS KNOWLEDGE THE KEY? 
The  economy  today  is  very  labor 
intensive.  A  high  number  of  firms  and 
workers  in  Africa,  Asia  and  Latin  America 
are linked to the global economy on heavy 
export-oriented  industries  such  as 
agriculture, clothing and technology [117].  
In  the  information  age,  Internet  and 
other  Information  and  Communication 
Technologies  are  creating  a  network  of 
information  and  knowledge.  This  allows 
workers  to  be  more  cooperative  among 
them. The intellectual property is going to 
be less relevant in an environment in which 
innovative  companies  are  getting  their 
innovations  from  outside  the  firms  and  it 
has  been  based  on  the  social  cooperation 
[118].

On  the  other  hand,  some  authors 
consent  that  in  the  twenty-first  century, 
emerging  countries,  especially  Brazil, 
Russia,  India  and  China  (BRIC),  strengthen 
their  own  national  system  of  innovation 
creating  new  Intellectual  Propriety  (IP)  for 
problems that current technology-exporting 
countries  find  so  daunting  [119]  [120]. 
Developing  countries  can  find  an 
opportunity to lead the creation of new IPs 
while  exploiting  technologies  and 
challenges  that  developed  countries  and 
avoiding  to  commit  the  same  mistakes  of 
the developed countries [119]. 
The  growing  number  of  IPs  in  the 
developing countries can cause some harm 
too. The great number of new patents and 
IPs  can  cause  a  scenario  of  choking  and 
blocking  of  the  technology  creation  [119]. 
This phenomenon, caused by low standard 
IPs, can be avoided by the creation of new, 
and more rigid standards for registering a 
new patent, and causing an over-protection 
of the IPs a country currently holds [119]. The  work,  in  the  economy  of  2050, 
changes  from  a  high-skilled,  technology-
intensive work, which emerged in 1980, to a 
knowledge-intensive  work.  Knowledge-
intensive services started with simple jobs, 
but  now  includes  advanced  business 
services, like finance, accounting, software, 
medical  services  and  engineering  [117]. 
These  types  of  jobs  are  seen  as  an 
opportunity  for  developing  economies  to 
reap technological and social benefits from 
technological  learning, knowledge  spillover 
and  higher  incomes.  Figure  7  shows  the 
increasing  share  of  knowledge-intensive 
works  on  different  Global  Production 
Networks.  
Knowledge-intensive  careers  provide 
fewer jobs when compared to other types 
of  work.  They  require  very  high  skills  and 
advanced  degrees,  mainly  in  the  fields  of 
science and engineering. The unskilled and 
less-educated majority in many countries is 
excluded  from  the  very  desirable 
employment opportunities provided by the 



 
Figure 7. Workforce composition across different Global Production Networks, from [117]. 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
WORKING IN 2050   27 

 
knowledge-intensive work [117].  
6.2. WILL AUTOMATION DESTROY OR 
ENHANCE THE 
ECONOMY? 
 Technology  alone  will  not  determine 
economic  results  in  terms  of  growth, 
inequality,  or  employment.  All  leading 
economies have had access to similar levels 
of technology, but have had very different 
outcomes throughout history because they 
have had different institutions and policies 
[121].  
Although  today  less  than  5%  of  the 
occupations  can  be  fully  automated  [14],  
the increasing automation will affect almost 
all  occupations,  not  only  factory  workers 
and  employees,  but  also  landscaping 
gardeners  and  dental  laboratory 
technicians,  stylists,  insurance  sales 
representatives  and  CEOs  to  a  greater  or 
lesser extent. 
Technological  progress  is  the  main 
driver  of 
per  capita  GDP  growth,  allowing 
output to rise faster than labor and capital. 
Increases  in  labor  productivity  generally 
translate  into  increases  in  average  wages, 
giving  workers  the  opportunity  to  reduce 
working  hours  and  offer  more  goods  and 
services [121]. 
These economic benefits, however, will 
not  necessarily  be  evenly  distributed  in 
society. For example, the  19
th century was 
characterized by technological changes that 
raised  the  productivity  of  less  skilled 
workers  relative  to  that  of  high-level 
workers [121]. 
In the United States, about 46% of the 
time spent on work activities in occupations 
and  industries  is  technically  automatable, 
based on current technologies. On a global 
scale, it is estimated that the adaptation of 
the  currently  developed  automation 
technologies  could  affect  50%  of  the 
working hours in the global economy [14]. 
This automation potential corresponds 
to the equivalent of 1.2 billion workers and to  US$  14.6  trillion  in  wages.  Among countries, the potential ranges  from 41 to 56 percent, with only four countries - China, 
India,  Japan  and  the  United  States - 
accounting  for  just  over  half  of  all  wages 
and workers [14]. 
The effects of AI will be felt unequally 
by the economy. New jobs will be created 
directly in areas such as the development of 
AI, as well as indirectly created in a variety 
of  areas  across  the  economy,  as  higher 
revenues lead to demand expansion [121]. 
The economy has repeatedly shown to 
be able to cope with this scale of change, 
although  it  depends  on  how  quickly 
changes occur and on what concentrations 
of losses on specific tasks [121]. 
6.3. WILL THE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY 
INCREASE INEQUALITY
? 
Advances  in  technology  are  going  to 
change  the  dynamic  in  the  labor  market. 
Automation  will  increase  unemployment 
and that will aggravate inequality [122]. On 
the other hand, there will be other ways to 
organize  production.  Alternative,  sharing, 
social,  green  and  creative  economy  will 
become  more  popular.  Social  banks  will 
support  these  initiatives.  For  that  reason, 
poverty is going to decrease and people will 
need to be able to reinvent themselves for 
finding alternative methods to make money 
[123].  
The  race  between  institutes  and 
technology will force companies to reinvest 
money  in  expensive  machines.  The 
competition between small companies and 
big companies is going to be unfair due to 
investment  power  differences.  In  this 
scenario,  small  companies  are  going  to 
close  their  doors  and  big  companies  are 
going to control the Market dynamics [124]. 
Academy  and  government  are 
important  pieces  in  that  discussion.  They 
have  responsibility  for  creating  and 
fomenting  technology,  respectively. New 
technologies may be used as a mechanism 
PART 1:  
K
EY TRENDS OF FUTURE WORK 
28 WORKING IN 2050 

P
K 
to  reduce  inequality  between  companies 
and  between  people.  The  Academy  can 
invest  in  new  ways  of  learning  and  the 
government  may  create  regulation  for  the 
society and markets [99]. 
Basic  income  is  a  policy  that  may  be 
created  by  a  government  in  order  to 
decrease  inequality -  minimum  wage  is  a 
common  example  of  this  type  of  social 
policy. This subject is much debated among 
specialists  in  the  area  and  is  also 
controversial. In a very short and reduced 
explanation,  some  of  them,  more  liberal, 
consider  that  basic  income  and  minimum 
wages  can  cause  a  disequilibrium  in  the 
labor  market  [125].  One  of  the 
consequences is inflation. In the other point 
of view, minimum wages and basic income 
are  an  important  public  policy  to  reduce 
wage inequality and to have more equality 
between  people.  Some  studies  consider 
that basic income and minimum wages can 
accelerate  the  market  through  stimulated 
aggregate demand [126].

In this part, we develop three scenarios for the Future Work:

the pessimist, which considers the worst; and the likely, which 
considers the trends we judged most probable.

7. OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO 
In  this  scenario,  we  present  an 
optimistic foresight in how working will be 
in  the  year  of  2050.  Using  the  trending 
changes identified in the 
Key Trends of the 
Future
,  we  present  our  view  for  the  next 
years if the best of the changes come to be. 
7.1. AUTOMATION 
In  this  scenario  we  will  not  reach  the 
singularity -  a  point  where  AI  triggers  an 
intelligence  explosion,  but  on  the  other 
hand, we will absorb a strong impact on the 
way  of  processing  data  and  information 
more  quickly  influenced  by  quantum 
computation.  Artificial  Intelligence  will  be 
controlled  by  global  and  democratic 
regulations among nations to prevent their 
undue use as the domination of humankind 
by  machines.  Artificial  Intelligence  will 
provide  a  scenario  in  2050  of  profound 
changes  in  work,  replacing  humans  with 
robots  and  software  in  various  areas, 
especially  in  tasks  that  do  not  use  critical 
thinking  and  the  accumulation  of 
knowledge  acquired  by  human  learning 
experiences. 
In this way, humans will adapt to a new 
reality  of  man-machine  synergy  in  the 
workplace.  The  collaboration  and  co-
creation of ideas and tasks will open up new 
opportunities for work with a deep balance 
in the management of natural resources. 
The concept that automation eliminates 
jobs will disappear, since humankind could 
observe for at least a century that the death 
of most professions is usually related to the 
birth  of  new  ones.  And  these  new 
professions  tend  to  have  a  better  income, 
because  they  are  often  more  knowledge-
based  than  the  previous  professions. 
Therefore,  the  automation  will  produce 
increased production and consumption. 
With the value saved in automation, the 
company can produce more and with more 
attractive  products,  inducing  an  increased 
consumption,  which  generates  new  jobs. More  jobs  opportunities  will  induce  wage increase,  which  induce  more  consumption and investment. Finally, more consumption induces  the  production  of  goods,  creating more jobs, in a virtuous circle. 
With  companies  being  able  to  earn 
more  money  from  the  same  number  of 
workers, they can theoretically increase the 
benefits for those workers. If they prefer to 
lower  the  prices,  these  workers  can  buy 
more  goods  with  the  same  amount  of 
money. 
Automation  does  not  come  to  make 
human work obsolete, but rather facilitate 
it, by replacing parts of jobs. In the future, 
we will have plausible metrics to help young 
people  deciding  between  professions  that 
will  be  ranked  according  to  their 
automation potential. 
7.2. EMPLOYMENT 
In this scenario, both governments and 
companies will recognize the need to train 
workers  that  will  lose  their  jobs  due  to 
automation  and  will  find  ways  to  do  so 
predictively. This will allow society to reap 
the  benefits  of  automation  such  as 
reduction  of  the  cost  of  living  and 
elimination of repetitive and risky jobs while 
reducing  the  impact  of  technological 
unemployment. 
Companies  will  accept  that  reduction 
and  flexibilization  of  working  hours  are 
necessary  to  keep  most  of  the  population 
employed. Governments will be prepared to 
educate  people  for  new  careers  while 
providing  a  Universal  Basic  Income  or 
Universal  Basic  Asset,  which  will  allow 
people  to  have  their  most  basic  needs 
tended to even when not working. To assist 
both  workers  in  improving  their 
employment  conditions  and  adapting  to 
new circumstances, unions will find ways to 
modernize  themselves.  The  geographical 
separation  between  workers  in  the  future 
economy and the rise of the Non-Standard 
Forms of Employment will be counteracted 
by ever improving worker organization that 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
WORKING IN 2050   31 

 
keep informed of the trends in employment 
and  use  the  same  technology  that  disrupt 
work for their benefit. 
Globalization  will  reach  its  most 
beneficial potential with workers dispersed 
around  the  world  collaborating  via 
computational  tools  such  as  augmented 
and virtual reality. This computer-mediated 
work  will  allow  people  to  do  more 
homework bringing workers closer to their 
families and neighborhood lives and, more 
importantly  for  the  globalization  impact, 
they  will  not  need  to  leave  their  home 
countries in order to find work. 
7.3. EDUCATION 
We  can  see  as  a  consequence  of  the 
trending  changes  and  advancements  of 
education,  learning  will  be  mostly  self-
taught, there will be easy and fast access to 
high  quality  education,  alas  the  education 
will  be  even  more  specialized  and 
knowledge-intensive  generating  a  deep 
improvement in the workforce that will be 
more qualified. 
With  the  increasing  personalization  of 
education  and  its  importance  to  the  new 
jobs  needs,  self-taught  provides  a  higher 
adaptability  to  the  worker.  Rather  than 
having  a  teacher  to  guide  the  student's 
education,  we  will  see  most  people 
searching  for  their  own  education  by 
themselves.  Technological  advancements 
and  its  integration  with  education  will 
provide  easy  access  to  knowledge  for 
everyone.  These  changes  will  not  only  be 
present  they  will  be  the  base  of  future 
education. Another reason for this change is 
how  people  will  have  more  free  time,  as 
jobs become less demanding in work hours, 
this will lead to people investing their free 
time  in  acquiring  new  knowledge  to  be 
ready  for  the  changes  in  their  work,  and 
changes  of  job,  which  will  be  very  much 
common. 
As  the  world  becomes  increasingly 
more technology-dependent, the education 
will  adapt  itself  to  this  new  world.  STEM education  will  grow  with  importance,  as STEM  jobs  will  be  more  common  in  the future  world.  Therefore,  this  technology integration  would  change  education  not only by grafting it on this new way of living, but by changing its core, and thus leading to the adaptation of the old education systems into new ones, that better fit this new core. 
As  this  new  education  will  be  highly 
structured,  there  will  be  little  need  of 
regularization or incentive by governments. 
However, as we make the shift to this new 
education we still need the government to 
assert  that  the  high  quality  of  education 
remains. 
7.4. SOCIAL WELFARE 
In this scenario, people will be able to 
retire  early  and  there  will  be  income  for 
people to spend on education and culture 
in their free time. 
Natural  and  fundamental  rights  are 
preserved  and  expanded.  With  the  use  of 
technology,  participatory  democracy 
broadens  and  allows  minorities  to  be 
protected, reducing social inequalities. The 
Universal  Basic  Income  will  be 
implemented.  Countries  are  moving  to 
cheaper  and  sustainable  energy,  allowing 
greater  savings  in  the  operation  of 
machines, devices, objects and computers. 
The  population's  income  will  provide  the 
basic  needs  of  food,  housing,  health  and 
education  and  will  allow  investments  in 
others such as leisure and fun. 
Satisfaction and human well-being will 
be  mediated  through  social  networks.  In 
this  way,  the  government  and  society, 
together,  will  design  a  new  Social  Welfare 
and  find  the  necessary  balance  through  a 
game where learning, innovation, research 
and  science  are  developed,  generating  a 
change in their mindset. 
7.5. ECONOMY 
In  this  scenario,  developing  countries 
start  to  grow  even  faster  until  2050: 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
32 WORKING IN 2050 

P
A 
countries  on  G20  grow  their  GDP  at  an 
average rate of three to four percent a year 
and the top economies of the world change. 
Countries  like  Brazil,  Indonesia,  India  and 
Mexico closes their technology gap with the 
developed  countries,  increasing  their  GDP 
and  creating  a  favorable  environment  for 
new  business  opportunities,  allowing  their 
population  to  engage  on  the  new 
opportunities. 
All  this  advancement  in  technology  is 
extremely important for workers, as it helps 
them  to  develop  and  update  their 
knowledge  and  skills.  In  a  world  where 
everyone  will  have  access  to  the  internet, 
the  ability  to  learn  new  things  from  open 
and free learning platforms will reduce the 
unemployment impact, because people will 
acquire new skills, mitigating the technology 
unemployment.  Thus,  these  technological 
advances  will  slow  down  the  growth  in 
inequality,  the  creation  of  new  jobs  and 
people having more free time to spend with 
family and to have fun. 
In  2050,  the  rapid  growth  of  the  global 
population also starts to decrease and the 
population  stabilizes  around  ten  billion 
people.  With  the  increased  population 
number, more cities start to appear. People 
start to migrate from larger cities to smaller 
ones,  with  better  living  conditions.  The 
urbanization  tends  to  reduce 
transportation,  health  and  infrastructure 
costs,  which  allows  the  government  to 
provide  better  conditions  to  the  people. 
New  cities  also  tend  to  offer  better  job 
opportunities and allow most of people to 
get  in  touch  with  the  emerging 
technologies. 
8. PESSIMIST SCENARIO 
In this scenario, we present a pessimist 
foresight of how working will be in the year 
of  2050.  Using  the  trending  changes 
identified in the 
Key Trends of the Future, 
we  present  our  view  of  the  upcoming 
decades if the worst is to happen. 
8.1. AUTOMATION 
In  this  scenario,  technology  will 
advance  quicker  than  predicted  by 
becoming increasingly cheaper resulting in 
a  high  unemployment  rate  as  employers 
see the benefits of changing their expensive 
workers  for  more  productive  machines. 
Public policies to help citizens dealing with 
this  scenario  will  not  be  created  leaving  a 
big portion of society out of the job market. 
The  owners  of  the  robots  and 
algorithms  that  caused  technological 
unemployment will "own the world" selling 
their  products  to  the  elite  that  is  able  to 
work.  
Therefore,  new  technologies  such  as 
IoT  will  not  fulfill  its  expected  growth 
because of the lack of demand, which raises 
its costs. Governments and companies will 
fail  to  realize  such  technologies' potential 
for  the  improvement  of  productivity  in 
industrial applications or for the betterment 
of  cities  by  the  use  of  smart  sensors,  for 
instance. 
8.2. EMPLOYMENT 
In  this  scenario,  societies  will  face 
technological unemployment mainly due to 
computerization -  advances  in  Artificial 
Intelligence and Robotics. As many careers 
cease  to  exist,  most  individuals  rely  solely 
on  governments  to  prepare  them  for  new 
jobs but this faith proves to be a wrong one 
as  not  even  the  government  knows  what 
can be done to create new occupations that 
are economically viable. 
This  will  lead  to  the  rise  of  an 
"extremely poor class" that is economically 
irrelevant  to  society  in  that  they  neither 
work  nor  consume.  Meanwhile,  the  ones 
that  control  the  machines  that  produce 
most of the wealth in the world will form a 
super elite, even richer and more powerful 
than the top 1% as we know it. The super 
elite  will  reap  the  benefits  of  automation 
and jobless growth making inequality even 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
WORKING IN 2050   33 

 
higher than in present with the increase of 
poverty. 
As wars continue to be waged - mainly 
on  the  Middle  East -  and  climate  change 
makes  few  coastal  regions  uninhabitable. 
Thus,  immigration  is  expected  to  increase 
causing  impacts  in  the  places  that  receive 
these fluxes such as higher unemployment 
rates and lower average wages. 
Furthermore, the intensification of the 
globalization of the workforce will increase 
immigration from poorer countries to richer 
ones.  In  this  scenario,  the  loss  of  jobs  to 
foreign  workers  will  be  made  easier  by 
advances in IT, which will allow companies 
to  hire  workers  from  wherever  they  cost 
less. 
Companies  will  not  reduce  working 
hours  making  some  women  feel  that 
working  conflicts  with  their  interest  of 
having children and the elderly are unable 
to find jobs because they need more time 
than  young  workers  to  take  care  of  their 
health, spend time with the family and rest. 
The  reluctance  of  changing  working 
hours creates a phenomenon where a small 
group  of  people  works  8  or  more  hours 
while a great number of people do not have 
a job or are neglected to gig to survive. 
The rise of new Non-Standard forms of 
Employment will create a plurality of types 
of  work  contracts  and  many  workers  will 
not  have  any  type  of  contract  with  their 
alleged  employers.  This  will  be  a  problem 
for labor rights, which will cover a smaller 
group  of  workers  than  it  does  today.  The 
workers  deprived  of  labor  rights  will  see 
themselves in an insecure situation as their 
employers do not recognize them as part of 
companies but as independent contractors. 
Few companies will dominate markets 
such  as  personal  transportation  and 
crowdsourcing allowing them to impose the 
rules  above  on  (or  supported  by)  any 
government power. As a result, workers in 
new  NSEs  will  not  be  able  to  unionize themselves despite their attempts to do so. Being  harder  to  fight  for  better  working conditions will make these workers enter in a  downward  spiral  with  respect  to  their labor rights.  
8.3. EDUCATION 
In  this  scenario,  education  will  not 
develop  at  the  same  pace  as  automation. 
Most news jobs will require knowledge and 
skills  that  very  few  people  have.  The 
personalization  of  the  education  will 
increase,  but  it  will  be  insufficient  for  the 
students to receive an adequate education. 
The  personalization  will  not  work  because 
the schools will have not build the structure 
to treat the students with individual needs, 
interests and preferences.  
The  traditional  model  of  education, 
which  ignores  the  different  needs  of  the 
students, will prevail. The schools that will 
be  trying  to  use  personalization  will 
significantly  fail.  As  result  of  this,  the 
improvement  of  education  will  not  be 
supported  by  the  government  creating 
insecurity and disbelief that it could work.  
Furthermore,  with  the  advances  of 
automation and new jobs, news skills will be 
required.  Most  workers  will  not  have 
developed skills such as managing people, 
solving problems, critical thinking,  and the 
common  cognitive  skills.  Self-employment 
becomes the principal and maybe the only, 
way  for  work  due  to  the  conditions 
economic and the demand of jobs. 
The demand of skilled labor becomes a 
crucial  element  in  the  economy  and  the 
Government will not able to deal with this 
problem.  Government  will  not  guide 
workers to educate for new careers.
Due  to  the  expected  demand,  the 
people  will  need  to  receiving  appropriate 
education and training for work. The group 
of  people  with  advanced  education  and 
training will be a part for all and they will 
not  be  able  to  occupy  new  jobs  created. 
Despite the advances of technology, part of 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
34 WORKING IN 2050 

P
A 
population will not receive the equal access 
for  education  and  training  because  this 
advance  will  not  achieve  everybody.  Some 
people will be to continue receiving a bad 
education either training or none of training 
to adapt for change jobs rapidly. 
 Open Access initiatives will fail due its 
high costs, increasing the number of people 
unprepared  for  to  work.  Besides,  MOOCs 
will be unsuccessful for part of population 
because for accept this kind of platform the 
technology must be integrated with people 
and  Government  needs  to  interfere.  Only 
part  of  the  population  with  a  minimum 
technology are going to receive this accept 
and they will occupy the jobs, concentrating 
the labor with them. The MOOCs such other 
forms  to  learn  will  not  be  regulated  from 
Government, decreasing the quality of the 
service. 
This  unfair  access  to  information  will 
hamper the knowledge acquisition process 
and reinforce the unpreparedness for most 
people.  The  knowledge-intensive  jobs  will 
be rare expensive because of this inducing 
the  significantly  difference  between 
demand  and  offer.  This  cost  raise  will 
difficult the entrance of new competitors - 
reinforcing  the  existing  elite.  Although  the 
delays  of  technology,  the  automation  will 
change  working  hours,  giving  more  free 
time  for  workers.  They  will  not  invest  the 
new free time in education for being able to 
occupy  new  jobs  and  the  changes  of 
careers, increasing the inappropriate labor.  
The  area  of  STEM  will  grow  up, 
especially the study of math and computers, 
but this process will not prepare people for 
all skills requirement for them work. Due to 
the  delays  of  technology  and  poor 
regulation of Government in education, the 
professionals  of  this  area  will  not  receive 
appropriate training and  education  for act 
in  jobs.  Generally,  this  professionals  are 
known  for  possess  critical  and  innovative 
thinking  but  this  skills  will  be  forgotten, 
focusing  only  in  technology.  It  will  form 
disable  professionals  for  developed products  and  services  looking  after  the needs of the new economy and people.  
8.4. SOCIAL WELFARE 
In  this  scenario,  advances  in  health 
combined  with  an  abundance  of  products 
and  services  due  to  automation  will  allow 
the richest stratum of society to live longer 
and better lives. In contrast, the portion of 
the population that does not have access to 
this  high-quality  life  will  age  with  a  poor 
health condition. 
The  inequality  between  these  two 
groups will not stop there. As policy makers 
perceive  the  aging  of  the  population,  they 
will  amend  the  legislation  to  increase  the 
retirement age. As the elderly remain in the 
labor  market  longer  to  be  eligible  for  a 
pension, it will be harder for young people 
to find job opportunities and will end up as 
part of the "extremely poor class". 
The trend of rising inequality  that has 
been  perceived  in  the  past  decades  will 
continue  in  the  future  as  governments  do 
not raise taxes on heritages and regressive 
taxes  keep  on  being  adopted  in  some 
nations.  The  concentration  of  money  and, 
consequently,  power  in  the  hands  of  the 
richest  (1%  and  0.1%)  is  aggravated  by 
automation  and  jobless  growth  as  a  small 
portion  of  the  population  will  own  the 
means of production while some people will 
not even have a job. 
Inequality  between  countries  will  also 
become worse as the Middle East is plagued 
by wars and most countries in the African 
continent  do  not  participate  in  the  new 
digital  economy.  Meanwhile,  advanced 
economies  such  as  England,  Germany, 
Japan  and  the  USA  will  control  the 
technology  being  created  and  the  data 
being produced worldwide allowing them to 
control the world economy. 
Besides  economic  inequality,  gender 
inequality will also  increase as reactionary 
movements get in the power and seize the 
rights  acquired  by  women  in  the  past 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
WORKING IN 2050   35 

 
decades.  Other  minorities,  such  afro-
descendants, and immigrants, will suffer as 
alt-right,  and  supremacist  movements  get 
more support. In this wave of conservative 
thought,  LGBTI  community  will  also  see 
almost  no  advancement  of  their  rights - 
and  possibly  some  regress.  As  countries 
face rising inequality, nationalist groups will 
increase in power and, as seen previously in 
history,  immigrants  will  be  pointed  as 
responsible for all the evils in the developed 
countries.  Wars,  climate  change  and 
increasing  poverty  will  intensify 
immigration  adding  more  fuel  to  the 
xenophobic movement. 
Ideas  such  as  Universal  Basic  Income 
and  Universal  Basic  Assets  will  not  gain 
strength  and  will  not  be  applied  in  most 
countries.  This  will  only  worsen  the 
situation of the portion of society unable to 
find a job, which will be left to starve. Part 
of this "extremely poor class" will not accept 
their  situation  in  the  economy,  creating  a 
security problem for governments as crimes 
rates increase. 
Machines  will  have  a  strong  role  in 
imposing rules on the population. Given the 
great social inequality, laws and security will 
be  realized  through  machines.  The  game 
will have a major imbalance for the poorest 
as  it  will  be  developed  by  governments, 
which will be strongly influenced by the big 
corporations.  
8.5. ECONOMY 
In  this  scenario,  the  economy  will 
continue  growing  faster;  however  HDI 
(Human  Development  Index)  will  not 
increase as GDP (Gross Domestic Product). 
This  will  decrease  the  social  equality, 
directly  affecting  public  services  in  areas 
such  as  health,  education  and  security. 
Inequality  will  reduce  the  macroeconomic 
stability and concentrate power in a - even 
smaller - minority. 
The  harder  access  to  education  will 
divide the society in two: those that can pay 
for  education  and  those  who  cannot.  The first group will be capable of competing for 
jobs in a shrinking market while the second 
group  will  have  to  fight  for  survival  doing 
any  kind  of  work  that  appears.  This 
situation will further increase the inequality 
taking  it  to  new  records  and  testing  the 
limits of governments to maintain society's 
order. 
Some countries will grow up faster with 
the  advances  in  technology  but  some  of 
them will not grow up. That will increase the 
gap  between  developed  and  undeveloped 
countries.  The  undeveloped  countries  will 
not be able to invest in modern technology 
and the necessary education. Thus, they will 
not  prepare  the  workers  for  new  careers, 
creating  a  difficult  obstacle  to  the 
development of these countries.  
Urbanization  will  grow  up  in  an 
unplanned  way.  The  people  living  in  rural 
areas will migrate for cities looking for a job 
and probably will not find them. As a result, 
people  unemployment  will  increase  in 
cities.  The  environment  will  be  altered 
because of the advances of technology and 
industries  without  the  correct  regulation 
from the government. The quality of air and 
water pollution will cause health hazards. 
9. LIKELY SCENARIO 
In  this  scenario,  we  present  a  likely 
foresight in how working will be in the year 
of  2050.  Using  the  trending  changes 
identified in the 
Key Trends of the Future, 
we present our view for working in 2050if 
the most probable trends come to fruition.  
9.1. AUTOMATION 
In  this  scenario,  the  advancement  of 
automation will result in the substitution of 
a  portion  of  workers  by  machines  and 
Artificial  Intelligence.  The  benefits 
generated  by  these  substitutions  are 
considerable and will promote widespread 
improvements  in  society,  e.g.  healthcare 
and  transportation  costs  reduction,  safer 
roads, and fewer human-mistakes on health 
care  treatments.  Meanwhile,  even 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
36 WORKING IN 2050 

P
A 
considering  the  benefits  provided  by 
automation,  the  government  will  keep  an 
eye on the unemployment rates in order to 
keep  it  controlled  while  promoting 
economic  growth.  The  balance  between 
automation and society demands is the key 
point  to  establish  a  virtuous  circle  in  the 
automation expansion. 
Governments  will  promote  regulatory 
policies, in order to control the balance of 
the  advancement  in  industry  automation 
without  locking  it  up  and  avoid  the  side 
effect  of  mass  unemployment  (or  at  least 
contain  its  fast  growth).  Such  policies  will 
aim  at  protecting  vulnerable  people  who 
will not be ready for this transformation. In 
a first moment, only jobs that involve a high 
creativity  load  will  remain  unaffected 
because  of  the  lack  of  technology  to 
emulate this behavior on AI. Governments 
and institutions will be able to contain this 
effect  by  investment  and  strengthening  of 
education,  with  the  aim  of  teaching  new 
jobs  in  areas  that  will  emerge.  Thus, 
governance institutions will be able to play 
a  key  role  in  this  scenario  as  mediators 
between  technology  advances  and  people 
needs. 
Technologies such as IoT will continue 
to  grow  along  with  its  demand.  The 
demographic  change  is  one  of  theirs 
drivers.  People  living  on  rural  areas  are 
migrating to urban areas. For that reason, 
there will be opportunities for IoT, Big Data 
and mainly for Smart Cities - topics already 
under  discussion.  Human,  Smart  and 
Sustainable will be keywords for cities in the 
future. Smart Cities is a term used since the 
1990s when a big movement claimed new 
politics for urban planning. Companies have 
been using this term for the integration of 
the  infrastructure  and  urban  services,  and 
will be a trend for the next 30 years. On one 
hand, automation will help cities to be more 
connected and smart.  
9.2. EMPLOYMENT 
In this scenario, new opportunities will 
arise  from  computerization,  with  better services and products being delivered but, at the same time, a portion of society will lose their jobs, being forced to look for new ones even if not prepared for it. Companies and  governments  will  take  precautionary measures  to  reduce  the  social  cost  of automation to society avoiding a collapse of the economy. 
Computerization  will  cause  the 
reduction  of  low-skill  and  low-wage  jobs. 
Most  of  these  people  will  face 
unemployment  and  companies  will  be 
stimulated to reduce the transition impact, 
training  their  workers  in  new  skills  before 
complete  automation  of  these  jobs.  The 
government  will  provide  them  a  basic 
income. This smoother transition will cause 
fewer  damages  to  society,  as  people  will 
keep consuming and the economy remains 
stable.  
Communication  will  be  improved 
globally  as  easier  access  to  optic  fiber 
extensions  and  wireless  technologies  will 
cheapen  the  access  to  internet  in  most 
countries. There will be a better integration 
between  international  and  national 
markets. More people in different countries 
will be able to work by the internet, but the 
quality of outsourcing job will not increase 
and  the  prices  will  be  the  same  as  it  is 
today.  
The  most  developed  countries  will  be 
able to automate the low-skill jobs, but the 
most part of developing  countries will not 
be at the same pace and they will use their 
low-skill  workforce  for  outsourcing.  Local 
markets  in  developed  countries  will  keep 
their  demand  of  medium  and  high-skilled 
people -  however,  computerization  will 
replace  most  of  low-skill  jobs.  On 
developing  countries,  the  demands  that 
require  lower  skills  or  repetitive  work  will 
be  either  outsourced  to  the  international 
market - from even poorer countries - or 
computerized  as  soon  the  prices  become 
affordable to these economies.  
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
WORKING IN 2050   37 

 
The government, motivated by the risk 
of  reduction  of  the  consumer  market,  will 
promote  the  flexibility  of  working  hours, 
increasing  the  employment  rate  and  the 
economic  growth.  The  medium  and  low-
skilled workers that keep their jobs will face 
a reduction from the traditional 40 hours to 
32  hours  per  week,  gaining  more  time  to 
use as desired. This change will reduce the 
salaries.  To  high-skilled  workers,  the 
flexibility will be an option considering that 
they  will  be  a  scarce  workforce  and  the 
wage will be open to negotiation. 
After  a  period  of  job  insecurity  and  a 
series  of  disputes  between  Non-Standard 
forms  of  Employment  (NSE)  workers  and 
their  employees,  the  new  types  of  work 
contracts will be better regulated  in order 
to provide minimum rights. These changes 
on regulation tend to improve the quality of 
services  and  reduce  the  conflicts  between 
employers  and  employees  on  this  job 
category  
Considering  the  new  forms  of 
employment,  workers  will  not  necessarily 
be associated to traditional trade unions as 
the ones we know. It will take some time for 
these  movements  to  be  recognized  by 
employers  and  by  governments,  but  as 
soon  as  it  happens,  this  movement  will 
create  ways  most  focused  on  the 
representation  of  workers  and  employers' 
interests, creating gains for both sides.  
9.3. EDUCATION 
In  this  scenario,  the  provision  and 
diffusion of MOOCs will allow a transition to 
a  "customized"  status  of  the  education 
process,  taking  into  account  individual 
needs and pace of learning; though it does 
not  mean  the  complete  dismissal  of  the 
teacher role, which can act as a tutor in this 
environment. Monitoring and regulation will 
be  required  for  this  new  methodology,  in 
order  to  avoid  break  or  conflict  with 
traditional  educational  models,  and  the 
government  will  take  a  key  role  in  this 
function.  This  transition  will  be  gradual, 
with  technology  serving  and  integrating with  current  methods  -   which  already 
happens  today,  on  a  smaller  scale  -   and 
progressively assuming its protagonist role 
in this future new schema. 
Such progress will have  consequences 
in the labor market. Training of workers will 
be  deeper  in  knowledge,  allowing  their 
adaptation  to  knowledge-intensive  jobs, 
which are the strongest trend for the future; 
again, governments can take a key role by 
helping and align the education with market 
needed  skills.  Additionally,  personalization 
of  education  methods  and  trends  of  jobs 
automation  will  make  possible  a  lower 
workload to the workers, allowing them free 
time to study and learn new skills, keeping 
them  updated  on  new  needs  and 
opportunities in each time and continuously 
in  the  future,  as  a  movement  of  lifelong 
learning.  Thus,  a  larger  part  of  the 
population  will  be  prepared  to  meet  the 
needs of the new roles and jobs, however, 
the  educational  technology  advances  will 
not reach everybody, letting a small portion 
of workers marginalized from jobs that are 
more qualified.  
Another  important  change  is  the 
influence of freedom of choice and learning 
versatility provided by the technology to the 
self-employment. In addition to a favorable 
scenario  for  collaboration  and  exchanges 
("gig  economy"),  self-employment  and 
entrepreneurship will increasingly take their 
place in the global labor market. 
9.4. SOCIAL WELFARE 
In  this  scenario,  society  will  increase 
the  demand  for  transparency  and 
representativeness.  The  technological 
evolution  in  tools  of  information  and 
communication will allow people to interact 
on  the  most  diverse  subjects  discussed  in 
the public field. Digital platforms, to provide 
discussion  and  voting  spaces  on  issues 
related to social demands. This new model 
of  participatory  democracy  will  have  to 
break  with  some  barriers.  The  traditional 
structures of governments will use political 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
38 WORKING IN 2050 

P
A 
power  to  resist  change;  legislative  power 
(policy makers) will be the most impacted. 
The  most  radical  groups  will  polarize 
the  discussions  in  the  political  arena.  This 
phenomenon  is  a  consequence  of  the 
greater  dissemination  of  their  ideas  and 
convictions. Moderates, in contrast, will be 
attacked from both sides and, thus, losing 
part  of  their  representativeness.  Besides, 
minorities  will  also  be  able  to  join  forces 
and empower themselves to confront social 
issues. 
Broad  dissemination  of  information 
and  education  will  play  important  roles  in 
promoting  the  protection  of  fundamental 
rights. The role of the government will be to 
promote discussions on the platforms and 
to provide citizens with the most impartial 
information  as  possible,  so  that  digital 
democracy  can  be  put  into  practice.  In 
addition, it must execute, with the support 
and  popular  participation,  the  winning 
proposals. 
With  greater  participation  of  the 
population in decisions, governments tend 
to  increase  the  regulation  of  corporate 
actions,  thus  reducing  the  political  power 
that large corporations have in the political 
arena. 
The tendency for decisions to balance 
demand  and  supply  will  promote  the 
reduction  of  working  hours.  Reducing  the 
working  day  will  have  a  major  impact  on 
how  society  will  organize  itself.  Less 
working  time  will  allow  an  increase  in 
leisure  time.  People  can  use  this  time  to 
stay  informed  and  participate  in  the 
discussions of the various political agendas. 
The  population  and  organized  groups 
will drive some adjustments and reforms in 
order  to  maintain  the  social  balance.  One 
example  of  legislation  adjustment  is  the 
increased of the minimum retirement age, 
as  the  population  ages.  In  this  case,  the 
government  will  play  an  important  role  in 
striking a balance between demand for jobs 
and supply. Another  important  factor  for  the 
reduction  of  social  inequality  will  be  the 
distribution  of  income.  By  promoting 
increased  taxation  through  progressive 
taxation in large corporations, in the great 
fortunes  of  the  people  and  in  the  goods 
received by the heirs, the government can 
distribute  wealth  to  poorer  sections  of 
society,  promoting  a  basic  income  for  the 
most  vulnerable.  Because  of  its  great 
impact  on  society,  the  Universal  Basic 
Income  should  not  reach  its  full  potential 
and inequalities will continue to exist. 
9.5. ECONOMY 
In  this  scenario,  countries  like  Brazil, 
China,  India,  Indonesia  and  Mexico  are 
likely to grow their GDP an average of three 
to  four  percent  per  year.  Mexico  and 
Indonesia  are  likely  to  be  economically 
larger than the United Kingdom and France 
while  Pakistan  and  Egypt  could  overtake 
Italy  and  Canada  on  a  Purchasing  Power 
Parity  (PPP)  basis.  In  terms  of  growth  per 
year, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh can be 
the fastest growing economies from now to 
2050.  
GDP  will  not  be  the  best  method  to 
measure  how  fast  a  country  is  developing 
itself -  others  indexes  are  already  being 
used,  such  as  the  Human  Development 
Index (HDI). People will worry more about 
their quality of life. For that reason, HDI will 
be  more  relevant  for  the  citizens.  Some 
methods for measuring HDI, especially the 
ones that are related to well-being will be 
incorporated  to  the  index.  Developed 
countries  might  worry  a  bit  more  about 
well-being  than  the  undeveloped  ones. 
While  developed  countries  will  be  on  the 
top and worrying about well-being for their 
citizens,  the  rest  will  be  still  concerned 
about  how  fast  they  are  growing  their 
economies (based on GDP) per year.  
In  this  scenario,  the  economy  will  be 
directly  impacted  by  automation:  it  will 
increase unemployment and that fact may 
contribute  to  increase  inequality.  The 
government will be the main responsible in 
PART 2:  
A
 VIEW OF FUTURE WORK IN 2050 
WORKING IN 2050   39 

 
this  role.  The  definition  of  new  ways  of 
working,  basic  income  and  new  public 
policies  will  be  decisive  tasks  to  the 
government. Countries that are prepared to 
it will succeed; the rest of them must learn 
how to deal with it. There is not a recipe. 
For that reason, the rules related to create 
new ways of employment and diversities of 
public  policies  does  not  apply  to  all 
countries.  
Governments  have  to  find  ways  to 
reinvent  themselves,  adapting  to  their 
specificities  and  building  their  own  public 
policies, possible mitigating the automation 
effects.  In  addition,  free  market  may  also 
help  society.  There  will  be  other  ways  to 
organize  production.  Alternative,  sharing, 
social,  green  and  creative  economy  will 
become more popular. Social banks will be 
important allies for that process. They can 
finance  these  initiatives,  so  that  is 
important  to  create  new  jobs,  moving 
economy and mitigating poverty. 
Although a worldwide-growth scenario 
is positive, this scenario is the one that slow 
down  the  inequality  increase.  Inequality 
may  be  considered  the  gap  between  the 
richest  people  and  the  poorest  people.  In 
the  future,  government  will  have  an 
important  role  in  this  discussion.  It  is  the 
only  responsible  to  regulate  that.  As  GDP 
grows, if it stays in the hands of the market, 
it  tends  to  concentrate  in  the  hands  of 
richest people. The government has to find 
out  ways  to  deal  with  that.  On  one  hand, 
government  cannot  be  an  impediment  for 
market's  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  it 
deserves  regulation  and  mechanisms  to 
redistribute GDP among people. It is a fine 
line;  each  country  will  have  to  make  your 
own  policies  according  to  their  specificity. 
The  one  that  insists  in  an  extreme  liberal 
economy  could  grow  its  GDP,  but  will 
increase  its  inequality  and  reduce  other 
index like HDI.  
The number of people in the cities will 
also grow, for two main reasons. First, the 
total  population  on  Earth  is  growing,  and second,  people  living  on  rural  areas  are migrating to urban areas. By 2050, 86% of the developed, and 64% of the developing world  will  be  urbanized.  This  behavior shows  some  negative  and  positive  trends, urbanization may cause unplanned growth of cities, health hazards caused by air and water pollution and unemployment. On the other  hand,  urbanization  can  reduce expenses  on  transports,  education  and create cultural diversity. 
Cities  will  be  smarter  and  more 
connected.  It  will  create  a  new  market, 
which is already possible to see. Solutions 
for connected and smart cities are today a 
kind  of  a  shy  market.  In  addition,  people 
will  start  working  at  home  more  than 
nowadays,  heating  the  economy  of  home-
office  products.  People  on  rural  areas  will 
migrate  to  urban  areas.  The  opposite  will 
also happen, but in a smaller level. Big cities 
will be crowded and some people will look 
for rural areas for retiring, for example. For 
that reason, rural areas are not going to be 
only for agriculture. Actually, this migration 
movement for rural areas will stimulate the 
local economy and will help to increase GDP 
and quality of life on rural areas.
