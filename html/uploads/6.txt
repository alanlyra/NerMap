The Future of Work
Skills and Resilience for a World of Change	
Issue 13 / 201610 June	EPSC Strategic Notes
Work glues societies together. It translates talent into broader economic virtue and lends meaning as\ 
well as structure to most people‚Äôs lives. In Europe, the majority of workers hold permanent contracts. 
However, tectonic shifts are re-shaping the ways that work is performed. First, the very architecture of 
the corporation is changing profoundly, largely powered by the Internet and digital technologies. Second, 
the perceived volatility of the economic recovery and the continuous exposure of the private sector to 
disruptive innovation push businesses to offer short-term contracts to respond quickly if a crisis strikes. 
Thus, many more job seekers are forced into short-term contracts, part-time work or other forms of labour 
which they see as undesirable. At the same time, in the digital economy ‚Äòprecarious‚Äô or ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô do 
not necessarily mean sub-optimal: more people voluntarily check out of t\he traditional ‚Äò9 to 5‚Äô job routine 
to pursue more independent and flexible work arrangements. Autonomy can be experienced as more 
empowering and satisfactory. This rise in freelancing runs parallel to the growth of the gig economy, where 
digital technologies enable teams to be assembled around a given project ‚Äì and often across borders ‚Äì 
while platforms seamlessly connect buyers with sellers. Much of the latter takes place under the heading 
collaborative economy, which is offering opportunity not only for people seeking more flexibility but also to 
those who have often had fewer chances of landing a permanent job. 	
The World of Work Has Always Evolved
The nature of work and the ways it is performed 
have changed multiple times and throughout 
human history. However, the pace of change has 
accelerated significantly, largely due to digital 
technologies. Many of today‚Äôs jobs and most 
sought-after skills did not exist a decade ago, while 
routine occupations are vulnerable to automation.
Opportunities, Disruptions and 
Transitions
Job polarisation and job displacement have 
intensified in advanced economies. At the same 
time, technological innovations offer new and flexible 
opportunities which often include those traditionally at 
the fringes of the labour markets. Policymakers need 
to manoeuvre between these two trends: preserving 
the core of a social market economy while being open 
to innovation and technology-driven change that 
impacts organisations and individuals alike. 	
Keep Learning for Life-Long Resilience
Skills continue to be the best guarantor of social mobility 
and opportunity. But skills are not static and need to be 
updated and fine-tuned throughout working lives. This 
too often contrasts with Europe‚Äôs educational systems 
which tend to be frontloaded. Opportunities for life-long 
learning are critical to support the numerous transitions 
that will likely characterise future employment. 
Public Policies Must Pave the Way 
and Accompany Change 
Well-crafted public policies need to keep track of 
changes in the world of work, using data and digital 
technologies to better understand evolving trends, and 
offer more targeted support to individuals. Active labour 
market policies will seek to buttress potential fallouts 
and adapt to new realities. For instance, they will ease 
the transition from employment to freelancing and back, 
seeking ways to provide more security to gig economy 
workers, or making greater efforts to provide customised 
skills and trainings that maximise employment potential.

1. Work 4.0 and Beyond
1.1. Trends and Transformations 
Work has always covered a diverse set of economic 
realities. It includes paid employment, own-account work, 
volunteering, as well as unpaid family work. Today, ‚Äòwork‚Äô 
is increasingly becoming an umbrella concept for tasks 
performed under different legal, functional and geographic 
frameworks. Jobs are being broken down into projects that 
may either be outsourced to independent professionals 
and experts, or be reconfigured into projects that assemble 
physical or virtual teams, across borders and time-zones. 
Non-essential tasks and functions have long been 
outsourced to allow companies to cut costs and focus 
their added value on core competences. Retail companies 
have used external contractors for their call centres and 
24/7 customer support services for decades. Similarly, 
consulting and accounting firms outsource basic research 
and accounting tasks, while publishing houses outsource 
type-setting and editing to production teams on other 
continents. This allows them to benefit from time-zone 
differences to get a speedier turn-around on their projects 
at lower costs. Companies have moved from vertical 
integration to restructured contractual relations allowing them to tap into global value chains and international 
talent as their needs and growth strategies evolve. In 
fact, as a global landscape of abundant and specialised 
knowledge becomes increasingly accessible, companies 
embrace the open innovation paradigm. In short, this 
involves harnessing external ideas and knowledge from 
multiple sources and combining these with internal 
capacities and R&D. The result is the ability to deliver 
efficient and innovative solutions to the marketplace. 
In today‚Äôs economy, the ability to scale rapidly and 
internationally is fundamental, thereby transforming the 
‚Äòcrowd‚Äô into part of the value-added chain.
In addition to its global dimension, outsourcing has 
taken on an added dimension through the rise of the gig 
economy	
1. It has created a dynamic environment in which 
temporary positions are common and organisations 
contract with independent workers for short-term 
engagements. Tasks can be broken down and distributed 
even more widely through apps and online platforms. The 
bidding-style process through which tasks are offered, 
assigned, and performed allows for real-time, interactive 
and often mutual rating of the performance of service 
providers (both for seller and buyer) and the reliability of 
users. Whether it is looking for a babysitter on care.com, 
assigning a local house-errand on Taskrabbit, or turning 
to 99designs.com to get designers from around the world 	
   From Work as Employment to the Open Talent Economy
‚ÄòOn demand‚Äô work is on the rise as is a ‚Äòproject-focused‚Äô approach to work. What has been referred to as the 
‚ÄòHollywood model‚Äô is a discernible trend across numerous sectors. \
How does this work in practice? Once a specific project, product or assignment is identified, a team of 
different people from different professions with distinct but complementary skills, comes together and 
collaborates in order to accomplish the task. Once the project is comple\ted, the team disassembles and 
reconfigures with other members on another project (just like in Hollywood, teams and artists move on 
to the production of another film). The pharmaceutical industry is an interesting area within which this 
model has developed. For decades, the entire process from early-stage research to consumer sales was 
undertaken within one company. Recently, research is often ceded to startups or research labs, where teams 
of scientists, senior executives, and/or supporting managers and staff work on a single development project 
with venture capitalist funding. If successful, the team might sell the \medication or its marketing rights to a 
company, disband, and move on to another project. 
This short-  term, highly flexible project-based business approach assembles people who hold specific 
skills and expertise for the particular requirements of the project and with a limited time and financial 
commitment. The adaptability of this approach is its advantage, particul\arly in conditions of economic 
uncertainty. It contrasts with the traditional corporate model, where employees are hired in long  er term, 
open-ended jobs. In this project-based reality, there are real concerns that the bidding or competition 
processes between workers may negatively impact employment, protection and safety standards. To reap 
the opportunities offered, public policy needs to adapt and better target those who fall through the cracks of 
the traditional social system, which was designed for full-time workers with permanent contracts.

to submit brand logo ideas in a contest round-the-clock, 
the gig economy offers ways to tap into talent, services 
and expertise at a global level with unprecedented 
affordability and transparency while rewarding the 
reputation, demand and compensation of the best 
performers.
1.2. Rise of Independent and 
Alternative Working Arrangements 
While the majority of workers are on permanent 
contracts, the preference for lean teams has led to a 
marked shift from ‚Äòemployees‚Äô to ‚Äòindependent suppliers 
of services‚Äô and ‚Äòindependent contractors.‚Äô
Self-employment in the EU constitutes 16.4 percent of 
the labour market	
2, with wide variation across Member 
States. Temps	3, agency workers, on-call workers, contract 
company workers, independent contractors, independent 
professionals or freelancers, as well as part-timers, 
have been on the rise	
4 (see Figure 1). In the case of 
Belgium for example, the number of hours worked 
by agency workers rose by over 11% in 2015 alone.	
5 
Similarly, in the USA, recent research suggests that all net 
employment growth since 2005 appears to have occurred 
in ‚Äòalternative‚Äô (i.e. non-standard) work arrangements- 
including temporary, gig and contract work. The overall 
percentage of workers engaged in alternative work 
arrangements rose from 10.1% in February 2005 to 
15.8% in late 2014.	
6 In the post-2008 period, companies 
are much more reluctant to offer full-term employment 
contracts given the volatile economic environment and 
the accelerating pace of global competition. This is more 
than likely to prevail in the years ahead. These trends are feeding a patchwork of parallel 
employment realities that characterise today‚Äôs developed 
economies. ‚ÄòNon-standard‚Äô work, in its numerous varieties, 
may offer greater flexibility and autonomy. At the same 
time it does tend to be less paid than the full-time 
equivalent, and is associated with less access to training. 
It is not the preferred option for many and it also brings 
greater risks due to frequent periods without or with 
very little income, as well as less favourable conditions 
in terms of accessing social security and necessary 
protection (healthcare, accident coverage and pensions 
primarily). On the other hand, these new forms of work 
can be a great accelerator for individuals who have been 
persistently shut out of the formal labour market. This is 
not to be under-estimated in times of a sluggish economic 
recovery creating too few jobs, and where concerns about 
the consequences of socio-economic marginalisation 
range from petty crime to the risks of radicalisation.

Figure 1: Employment Trends in the 
European Union: A Snapshot	
Full-Time, Life-Long Corporate Jobs More Likely an Interlude than the Norm
Although there is widespread conviction that long-term corporate jobs ar\e the norm and that temporary work is 
a novel form of ‚Äònon-standard‚Äô work, the opposite is likely the case. 
Long-term corporate jobs guaranteeing full-time, life-long job security and benefits only became dominant in 
the ‚Äòtrentes glorieuses‚Äô after 1945	
7. These developed as assembly lines and industrial machinery grew more 
complicated in times of full employment, making the need for a stable trained workforce to control quality 
and maximise production more pressing on the employers‚Äô side. In parallel, the urban concentration of workers 
encouraged the advocacy for better employment conditions, and eventually privileges, in exchange for loyalty. 
Full-time, life-long corporate jobs that emerged in the post-World-War II period have been overwhelmingly 
occupied by prime- and working-age men. The employment trajectories of women, younger workers, people with 
a migrant background, or also people with disabilities have been rather different, characterised by lower rates of 
employment and higher rates of part-time, temporary or self-employment. They have also faced more implicit 
forms of discrimination in the workplace, even though officially the legal framework for equal opportunities and 
non-discrimination should prevent this

2. Gains, Losses and Changes 
in the World of Work
2.1. What Is Changing, And What is Not
Labour reallocation, i.e. the sum of job creation and job 
destruction, is intensifying. As new jobs are created, 
others risk being destroyed.	
9 Depending on which tasks 
we currently assume may be replaced, estimates on 
the impact of automation on jobs vary, but there are 
certain telling trends. Machines are already capable 
of answering email and drafting summaries of sports‚Äô 
games. We may soon see driverless cars at the traffic 
lights, drones delivering goods, and algorithms replacing 
accountants, bank staff and legal assistance.	
10	
The sectors most at risk of contraction in the future 
world of work are those that rely heavily on routine 
tasks, such as low-skill manufacturing jobs, but also 
some craft and clerical occupations (Figure 2). Where 
tasks are routine, automation is likely. As the trend 
towards more service-oriented economies is likely to 
continue	
11, job growth in the future can be expected to 
be in the service sector and particularly in non-routine 
elementary occupations such as personal care services. Automation is by no means a synonym for work 
extinction. Indeed, ‚Äòsubstitution may mean the 
destruction of certain jobs, but not the destruction of 
employment.‚Äô	
12 Certain estimates expect automation to 
lead to a net loss of more than 5.1 million jobs across 
15 major advanced economies (see Figure 3).

At the same time, the digital revolution has generated 
a surge in demand for new jobs and occupational 
categories that did not even exist a decade ago.	
14 These 
include people with a high technology quotient such as 
big data specialists, social media managers, cognitive 
computing engineers, Internet of Things architects and 
blockchain developers. 
The transformative trends of the digital revolution have 
also highlighted that some jobs will quite simply always 
be performed by humans, either because of the sort of 
skills required, or simply because of our preferences. 
Child care, care for the elderly, social work, mental 
health care for instance, easily stand out as jobs with 
low risk of automation.
The fact that certain tasks can be performed by 
technology means that time is ‚Äòfreed‚Äô up for workers to 
perform other tasks and create value. As automation 
and artificial intelligence are leaping into new areas, the 
human-robot partnership will further transform the nature 
of work. Until now, the challenge for workers was to learn 
how to operate machines. Looking ahead, interactions will 
change with humans monitoring rather than operating 
machines and creatively defining what needs to be done 
and how, and then using robots to achieve precisely that. 
If recent trends are telling indicators, creativity, emotional 
intelligence and transversal skills are undoubtedly what 
will make the difference in the future (Figure 4). Research 
has shown that occupations requiring strong social, 
interpersonal skills and non-routine analytical skills have 
grown dynamically since 1980 with consistent wage 
growth.	
15 Even in the tech industry, it is jobs that require 
both technical and interpersonal skills that are on the rise.  Cultures of sharing, negotiating with others and finding 
compromises seems to be what can ‚Äòsave us‚Äô from 
the robots. Europe‚Äôs advantage in the future highly-
automated world of work lies in its creativity and highly-
skilled workforce (Figure 5). A 2015 study	
16 finds that 
21% of US employment is highly creative ‚Äì including 
occupations like artists, architects, web designers, IT 
specialists and public relations professionals. Economies 
like the UK where creative occupations make up a large 
proportion (around 24%) of the workforce may be better 
placed than others to resist the employment fallouts of 
automation. 	
2.2. Capturing Value in the New World 
of Work 
In this transformative context, charting a successful 
course in the world of work depends to a large extent 
on the quality of firms. Entrants and young firms remain 
the biggest contributors to employment creation in the 
OECD countries	
17 (see Figure 6). However, it is highly-
productive and internationally-active firms that have an 
exceptional impact on economic growth and expansion 
of employment. On average, about one percent of the 
internationalised, high-performing manufacturing firms 
in Europe produce more than 75% of output or foreign 
sales.	
18 The changing world of work means that they 
will increasingly compete for the pool of available global 
talent.

Indeed, the most job-creating ‚Äì and productive ‚Äì firms, 
the so-called ‚Äòfrontier firms‚Äô, as well as the younger 
gazelles (a subset of rapidly growing firms) are 
seeking high-skilled and digitally-savvy workers	
19 (see 
Table 1). As productivity gains result from investments 
in knowledge-based capital, it is no coincidence that 
top growth occupations in employee numbers are 
mostly high skilled ones, including software and sales 
professionals, where ICTs increase the returns to labour 
for highly skilled workers performing cognitive tasks.	
20	
A particular concern for Europe is the projected 
skills shortage in the area of ICT (Information and 
Communications Technology), which is forecast to lead 
to up to 825,000 unfilled vacancies by 2020.This is not 
only a lost opportunity for job seekers but also has the 
potential to be a real break on productivity and innovation, 
as well as the wider modernisation of the economy.	
3. Changing Work-Life 
Patterns and Preferences
The profound changes underway are also accompanied 
by substantial transformations in people‚Äôs working life. 
Until recently, there has been a rather linear pattern in 
the transition from education and training, to work and 
retirement. This linearity is now largely a thing of the past.
Given the changes in the workplace, people will have 
to increasingly learn new skills to remain employable 
throughout their working life. They will be increasingly 
likely to change employers, jobs, employment status and 
professions numerous times and at faster paces than 
ever before. And, given that people live longer, they will 
most likely also have to work longer, either out of choice 
or necessity. While some have the tools and mindset to 
embrace this flexibly, not all are equipped with the skills, 
competences and support system to be able to respond 
to these changes.
At present, multiple and divergent realities coexist in 
Europe‚Äôs job markets. It remains difficult for women 
to re-enter the labour market after they have taken 
time out to raise children. Young graduates who have 
spent numerous years in full-time university education 
have the hardest time getting their first job, and 
often lack the skills necessary in spite of their formal 
qualifications. Similarly, 45-year olds who where laid 
off due to sectoral restructuring find it difficult to get 
a new job as they are often deemed ‚Äòtoo expensive‚Äô, 
or even ‚Äòtoo old‚Äô to retrain. In short, many people 
find themselves excluded from gainful employment, 
let alone the opportunity to pursue quality work ‚Äì a 
challenge which has been accentuated by the crisis.
For these reasons, training and reskilling will matter 
more throughout people‚Äôs working lives. Education 
obtained before one‚Äôs professional life will have to be 
regularly ‚Äòtopped-up‚Äô. Transitions will be more frequent 
and complex - particularly with regards to family and 
care responsibilities on the one hand, and employment 
and training on the other. These will have to be better 
supported than they are today.
At the same time, work-life balance preferences are 
changing. Millennials are keen to have more diversity 
and also more flexibility in their work patterns and 
commitments. They are reinventing the essence of 
economic exchange, professional fulfilment, and even 
consumption itself through the collaborative economy and 
a growing army of ‚Äòprosumers‚Äô, with products and services 
being delivered on-demand and just-in-time. As for more 
mature workers, especially highly skilled, they are less 
and less interested in retirement and prefer to stay in the 
workforce for longer, albeit with flexible arrangements.

Work tenure is also changing at a rapid pace. In the US, 
the median tenure of workers aged 25 to 34 years is 3 
years which is three times less than that for workers aged 
55 to 64 (10.4 years).	
  As for the EU 28, the changes for 
the 25-34 year olds between 2000 and 2014, are telling 
too. Job tenure of 10 years and over decreased from 
17.5% to 12.5%, while job tenure for 3-5 years increased 
from 17.7% to 19.4%.
22 This shorter tenure is not just the 
result of shorter time spent on the job market, it is also a 
conscious choice. It follows that one might soon have 15-
20 different jobs in a lifetime.
As work patterns change and preferences shift, one 
dimension that does remain constant is a rather 
fundamental human need for belonging to a community. 
Freelancers and independent professionals are forming 
groups and associations, formally, informally and virtually. 
One such group is the Freelancers Union, based in New 
York. Through associations such as these, they exchange 
experiences, seek advice, even lobby on work‚Äì and 
welfare‚Äìrelated issues. They also create community 
co-working spaces which allow new businesses to be 
created and create hubs of innovation that help kick start 
entrepreneurial ideas.
In the new world of work, attention is increasingly 
on the individual. The de-construction of work, the 
multiplication of professional pursuits in one‚Äôs lifetime, 
the growing burden on individual adaptation to 
employment driven by automation and competition in 
the high-value segment are some of the more evident 
manifestations. While the jury is out on which of these 
trends will have positive or negative outcomes, resilient 
skills will be the game changers. 	
4. The Future of Work is All 
About Skills
The novel fluidity of work puts a premium on personal 
initiative and professional resilience. The link between 
employer and employee is being loosened, and this 
has repercussions for both. For employers who have to 
operate in a global context of high economic uncertainty, 	
investing in the systematic development of their staff 
is often a challenge. This is particularly so in the case of 
temporary or contract staff. At the same time, it matters 
hugely to a company‚Äôs success to be able to access a 
workforce with directly usable skills and qualifications. 
As for workers, the burden of employment is shifted to her/
his abilities to adapt and remain relevant, and to ensure 
adequate access to welfare, decent and fair work conditions 
and sustainable employment protection. While many are 
driven by the preference for agency and autonomy, not all 
workers have the tools to be equally self-resilient nor to 
sustainably tackle societal, personal and professional risks. 
Access to up- and re-skilling opportunities that have currency 
on the job-market, and to adequate welfare protection are 
the most fundamental challenges that workers and job 
seekers are confronted with in the changing world of work.
In recent years, the polarisation of today‚Äôs workforce 
between highly-skilled, well-paid jobs and lower-paid, low-
skilled ones has intensified.	
23 Meanwhile, the  share of the 
low-educated is contracting across all major occupational 
groups, even in ‚Äòelementary occupations‚Äô where it fell by 
four percentage points between 2008 and 2012. Such 
an environment may compound the efficient matching 
of skills and jobs available in Europe. Evidence from 
Sweden suggests a link between displacement rates and 
educational level: well-educated, native-born prime age 
men have the highest chances of re-employment. Workers 
who are involuntarily separated from their job due to 
economic or (increasingly) technological reasons tend 
to suffer wage losses upon entering a new job, typically 
attributed to a loss of job-specific skills.	
24	
The risks of growing polarisation and displacement can be 
addressed by bolstering the resilience of workers through 
re-skilling and up-skilling opportunities throughout one‚Äôs 
life, especially at a time when career transitions and self- or 
temporary employment are increasingly the new normal. 
In-work access to training remains highly dependent on 
the type of contract: almost one in two employees on 
permanent contracts receive training compared to 32% of 
employees with fixed contracts and 19% of self-employed.	
25 	
Thus, it is often the case that those who need life-long 
training the most are those who have the least access to it.
5. Dynamic and Resilience-
Building Public Policies
Zygmunt Bauman, one of the world‚Äôs leading sociologists, 
has described the current uncertainty and unpredictability 
‚Äì as well as the inequalities in the ways risks and 
opportunities are experienced ‚Äì as living in ‚Äòliquid times‚Äô.	
26 
The post-crisis environment is characterised by particularly 
high levels of unpredictability for both workers and 
businesses. The transitions that the digital revolution is 	
‚ÄòThere‚Äôs never been a better time to be a worker 
with special skills or the right education, because 
these people can use technology to create and 
capture value. However, there‚Äôs never been a worse

bringing to all aspects of our work and life - both in their 
challenges and their opportunities are likely to magnify the 
sense of unpredictability and complexity even further.
Public policy therefore needs to respond more dynamically 
to the changing reality of the world of work. Rather 
than being about the anonymous and largely uniform 
membership of the labour market, it needs to respond to 
the diverse journeys people undertake throughout their life 
and careers with anticipation and innovation. This requires a 
comprehensive approach that includes: refitting education, 
supporting firms in growth and job creation through 
investing in skills, customising and ensuring portability of 
social rights, and developing indicators that enable public 
investment to lead to effective social outcomes.
The European Commission‚Äôs initiative to launch a European 
Pillar of Social Rights aims to identify the most 
transformative trends within work and welfare systems, the 
changing needs in employment and social policies, and the 
good practices in meeting these challenges and opportunities. 
In effect, a dedicated focus of the on-going public consultation 
process (March ‚Äì December 2016) is on the Future of Work.
5.1. Refitting Education 
The changing world of work requires a multi-layered policy 
response, covering the entire life-trajectory, from cradle 
to retirement. Education, training and the opportunity for 
retraining throughout one‚Äôs life need to be the starting point. 
The most important capital for the world of work ahead is 
skills, and yet, many youths as well as adults across Europe 
have considerable basic cognitive and non-cognitive skills‚Äô 
deficits even if they hold formal qualifications.	
27	
The importance of non-cognitive skills for the labour 
market has been widely recognised. Such skills range 
from achievement motivation, perseverance, problem-
solving, resilience, self-control, team-work, initiative, 
the ability to socialise and to follow an ethical code 
of behaviour.	
28 However, today‚Äôs education systems 
are not always proficient in the provision of these 
sorts of skills. In many EU Member States, training in 
basic economic and financial literacy is not part of the 
standard curriculum and training on digital literacy and 
entrepreneurship has still much room to cover.

5.2. Skills Endowment 
The increased likelihood of job changes, contractual and on-
demand work, means that it will be more difficult to target 
training and retraining. Therefore, the risk of human capital 
depletion could grow. As already mentioned, employers may 
be more selective when investing in their employees‚Äô training 
or reskilling. This means that new arrangements will have to 
be crafted to effectively share the burden of (regular) training 
between individual workers, employers, and the state.
Today, publically-financed education is mainly 
directed towards children and young adults not yet in 
employment. In the future, such arrangements need to focus just as much on workers and job-seekers aiming 
to fundamentally improve their employability. 
Innovative public‚Äìprivate partnerships between schools, 
universities and private training providers, should be 
encouraged to invest in skills-development and human 
capital of a fluid and highly mobile workforce.
Such a ‚Äòskills endowment‚Äô could be pre-financed through 
education-linked loans that would only have to be paid back 
when and if the recipient achieves a certain level of income 
through their subsequent employment. This investment 
approach draws from the English student loans model. 	
Skill Development in Flagship EU Funding Programmes
The European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund will inject over EUR 30 billion to support skills 
development in the period 2014-2020, while the Erasmus+ programme supports skills development in education and 
training with nearly EUR 15 billion. Moreover, through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), the EU 
plans to invest EUR 454 billion in Europe‚Äôs cities and regions, while channelling funding to over 2 million enterprises to 
support growth, increase competitiveness, develop projects and most importantly, create new jobs.
In addition to the ESIF, bridging the investment gap through the implementation of the European Fund for Strategic 
Investments (EFSI) can have a significant impact on improving Europe‚Äôs job prospects. Human capital formation 
is a core priority area of EFSI while its most successful spending vehicle to date is aimed at SMEs and mid-cap 
companies. It is estimated that 1.8 million jobs can be created directly or indirectly through the leveraging effect of 
the Investment Plan on the assumption that projects selected do not ‚Äò\crowd out‚Äô private investment.	
32	
 
Mainstreaming EFSI to areas with highest unemployment levels can help address labour market disparities 
across the EU while synergy should also be established with the smart sp\ecialisation strategy. Complementary 
support to skill development can generate additional positive gains in t\he volume of employment.
Indeed, the EFSI regulation states clearly that projects in the field of human capital, culture and health should 
include education, training, the development of ICT skills and digital education. Member States should off
er 
customised training programmes to improve the skills-matching performance of the labour market in the sectors 
benefiting from the EFSI. Beyond complementing Member States actions, a dedicated ‚Äòhuman capital investment‚Äô 
instrument could be added to the EFSI, providing pooled finance for investment in this area in the same way that 
the framework already does for SMEs.
Refitting education for the demands of the world of work 
requires novel forms of schooling and teaching with 
a focus on the application of knowledge. Transversal 
competences  - such as better management of one‚Äôs 
own learning, social and interpersonal relations and 
communication - need to be integrated in all learning 
methods from pre-school to training schemes for 
mature workers (Figure 8).	
29 As David Deming of Harvard 
University once observed, the most advanced preschool 
classrooms ‚Äòlook a lot like the modern work world‚Äô. 
‚ÄòChildren move from art projects to science experiments 
to the playground in small groups, and their most 
important skills are sharing and negotiating with others.‚Äô	
30 	
Similarly, social skills need to be part of the curriculum to 
create conditions for complementing technology with the 
human touch. In many business and medical schools, so-
called flipped classrooms focus on interactive discussion 
while lectures are to be followed online outside of the  classroom. Vocational training schemes that successfully 
complement vocational skills with instruction in maths, 
science and language, like in Germany‚Äôs dual education 
system, are well equiped for the changing employment 
landscape while providing flexibility for life-long learning. 
Apart from promoting new ways of learning, it is equally 
important to ensure access to world-class education and 
talent, to make sure that the EU‚Äôs younger generation 
sources from international best practices. 
In the collaborative work culture and economy of the 
future, having broader analytical skills and knowledge, 
and being able to learn fast by linking up different 
perspectives from different disciplines, appears more 
relevant than ever.	31 This competence is often referred 
to as T-shaped skills, where the T represents the depth 
of an expertise in a single field, whereas the horizontal 
bar is the ability to collaborate across disciplines.

5.3. Customisation of Social Policy 
Re-designing employment services and active 
employment policies for a flexible world of work calls 
for governments to find more innovative ways of policy 
intervention. Supporting employability can no longer be 
a one-off action. It involves a series of measures and instruments that may be personalised at different stages 
of one‚Äôs working life. As workers are more likely to change 
employers, jobs, sectors and even countries, benefits and 
protection must be linked to the individual and not to 
jobs or unemployment, which disadvantages those with 
non-standard employment or risks unwillingly incentivising 
informal work or inactivity.	
Examples of Customised Policy in Member States 
‚Ä¢ 
France‚Äôs Compte Personnel d‚ÄôActivit√© (CPA)	33 is anticipated to be in place early 2017, as introduced 
by the 2015 Bill on Social Dialogue and Employment. Its aim is to enable individuals to decide how to best 
mobilise their benefits to fit their individual circumstances. The CPA would guarantee that benefits are no longer 
contingent on an individual‚Äôs job. Instead, an individual activity account would provide each active member of the 
labour force their social benefits (training, support to start a business, shift to part-time work, early retirement) in 
the form of points, regardless of employment status. These benefits ‚Äì in the form of ‚Äòpoints‚Äô ‚Äì would be adjusted 
to correct for different inequalities, targeting in particular early school leavers, under 26 year olds in precarious 
employment, granting them more points than their university-graduate peers for example. 
‚Ä¢  The Czech ‚ÄòEducation and work‚Äô web portal
34 was established as part of the reform of education and 
training policies aimed at ensuring that individuals are better able to \discover, validate and further develop 
outcomes of prior learning. The tool links existing vacancy databases to\ information on training courses, 
providers, and generic occupation overviews. It intends to create practical individual pathways to benefit 
from the possibilities of the national qualifications framework. Through user self-assessment, using the skill 
descriptions found in the vocational qualifications, and by suggesting possibilities for gaining a vocational 
qualification that is purely skill/competence-based and matched to labour mark et needs, the instrument 
matches skills with jobs (and the other way around).	
Assembling Individual Tasks into a Standard Contract
Care and non-care personal and household services in Europe are increasi\ngly outsourced by households to 
third parties. The care sector, which has a notable potential in terms of job creation, is largely cha\racterised by 
undeclared labour and therefore uncertain and even risky working conditions. Certain schemes, however, have been 
particularly successful in creating formal jobs leading to standard contracts and full social protection coverage. 
The  Titres-Services voucher model established in Belgium since 2004 is one such successful example. Workers 
are employed by an organisation (private or public, for-profit or not) that sells the services to different households. 
Households pre-purchase vouchers, usually on-line and use these to request the services they need (cleaning, 
washing, ironing, gardening, shopping, meal preparation, etc) from the \company. The company then assigns the 
tasks to a worker. The price of each hourly voucher is set by the state which also offers a 30% tax deduction to 
users of Titres-Services, thereby providing users with an incentive to prefer a formal arrangement for these services 
over undeclared work. For the worker, the accumulation of vouchers by working in different households each day 
offers them access to a formal labour contract guaranteeing the same rights as any other worker, including paid 
vacation, health and pension rights. Depending on the number of vouchers\ collected the worker may choose to 
work part-time or full-time and after three consecutive months with the same provider, fixed-term contracts 
become open-ended. Employers can benefit from a reduction in their social contribution if they recruit long-term 
unemployed participating in activation programmes. Unemployed persons and recipients of social assistance are 
targeted by this measure, as 60% of jobs under the scheme must be attributed to such categories of people.
The scheme is quite costly for the public purse due to the tax-reduction offered. However, the direct and indirect 
advantages far outnumber the costs. Among these: decrease in unemployment; new social contributions; new 
receipts on personal income tax; the impact on consumption from new work\ers; the indirect creation of new jobs 
like administrative jobs in the agencies and freeing up women who use the v\ouchers to free up time so they can 
pursue their own careers. And of course, the societal benefits of creating new jobs particularly for low-skilled 
workers under decent working conditions and social protection, and reducing \the informal sector.

One way of going about customisation of social policy 
could be the establishment of notional personal 
human capital accounts to create a pool of resources 
for everyone to use throughout their careers. Depending 
on specific requirements, the resources could be used 
for training and retraining purposes related to work 
assignments. Apart from a fraction of their salary being 
designated for the function, workers would be in the 
position to benefit from tax-free contributions to their 
schemes from employers and/or public and private 
partners. The scheme could be relevant for all workers, 
whether holding fixed contracts or being self-employed, 
further levelling the field in the world of work. 
5.4. Data is Knowledge and Key for 
Effective Policies
We still know little about the new dynamics described 
above and how firms and workers cope with them. 
Measuring resilience, targeting investment, assessing 
the return, and turning public intervention to where it is 
needed the most requires the use of micro-data.
Big data offers an unprecedented opportunity to track 
and anticipate gaps in skills, map mismatches and 
polarisation in the job market, and marry employers‚Äô need 
with employees‚Äô capabilities. It also offers transparency 
for individuals to understand potential career options, 
education and training requirements and how these 
are remunerated in the labour market. Modernising and 
expanding job classifications may also be necessary 
given the transformations underway.
What is more, big data offers policymakers the chance 
to leverage behavioural insights and avoid inefficiencies 
in implementation. Experience of agencies such as the 
UK Behavioural Insights Team with the Department for 
Work and Pensions shows that studying the behaviour 
of job-seekers can substantially increase policy returns. 
There is a case for accelerating and streamlining the 
adoption of data-driven and evidence-based policy 
and decision-making. A number of ongoing projects 
yield very promising results, including Vacancies for 
ICT ‚Äì Online Repository (Victory project), which is a big 
data related pilot initiative to map online vacancies for 
jobs and associated skills. Another example is www.
data4policy.eu, which supports big data and other 
innovative data-driven approaches for evidence-based 
policy making. 	
Finally, combining the potential of big data with more 
regular labour force surveys would permit to better 
monitor changes in the pace and nature of work 
relationships. This is fundamental to understand the 
forces affecting the European economy, the working 
conditions, and the quality of life of European workers. 
These precise efforts are already underway in the US 
with the RAND-Princeton Contingent Worker Survey 
(RPCWS) in 2015. The Contingent Worker Survey tracks 
alternative (or non-standard) work relationships in the 
United States. It had not been conducted since 2005 
meaning there was a substantial lack of data on on-
going labour market developments. To respond to this 
data-void, Lawrence F. Katz from Harvard University 
and Alan B. Krueger from Princeton University based 
themselves on the Bureau‚Äôs Contingent Worker Survey 
and expanded it to gain more complete information on 
work arrangements. Having more dynamic data is core 
to be able to monitor and diagnose developments in 
Europe‚Äôs labour markets.  
Effectively investing in people requires that 
governments make their instruments for social 
investment user-centred. Drawing on the pools of 
available data governments identify future needs for 
policy intervention as well as emerging vulnerabilities 
and opportunities that may be better tapped into 
through early activation measures. 
Conclusions
The world of work is part-and-parcel of the changing 
economy, heavily influenced by globalisation, international 
value and supply chains, more division of labour, and 
digital disruption. Work is no longer a static concept 
but an umbrella term for roles performed in a different 
manner and under different legal arrangements. Public 
policy needs to adapt to this new situation and benefit 
from the agility that comes with it while mitigating the 
downsides. Europe has a strong manufacturing base, 
a diverse and talented workforce and a large creative 
economy that offer a rich backdrop for a future of work 
with creative and fulfilling jobs. By orchestrating more 
tailor-made, customised interventions, based on granular 
insights provided by big data sources, it can achieve 
better results and foster the context within which both 
individuals and firms can thrive. Governments need 
to find more innovative ways to offer life-long and 
personalised support for employment, skills and welfare, 
adapted to the needs of individuals.
