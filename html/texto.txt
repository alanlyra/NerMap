[T] Some of these issues have been identified among the extant growth drivers of the economy, which are likely to persist over/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED couple of decades and some are analysed in the next section.

Growth drivers and some trends There is a fair consensus that long-term growth drivers of the Indian economy are intact and there are several reasons for GDP growth to be sustained at a high rate of 8 to 9 percent per annum the/B_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED few decades.

Consequently, the probability of selecting a fixed set of policies today that will be optimal over/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/M_TEMPPRED several/E_TEMPPRED 50–100 years is zero.
