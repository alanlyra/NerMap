By/U_TEMPPRED 2030 the number of people aged over 60 is some 40% higher than at the turn of the century.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030, Switzerland had one of the highest proportions of foreign residents in Europe, as it did at the beginning of the century.

The net result is that the total population, 82 million at the start of the century, has declined to 71.5 million by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

Here, by/U_TEMPPRED 2030, people over 65 accounted for almost half the adult population, compared with one-fifth at the beginning of the century.

In the UK for instance, compared with the 300 people aged 100+ in 1950, in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 there is a growing expectation that living for a century will be the norm for thousands of people.

However, a previous lack of regulation of internal movements has meant that although the extent of population decline and ageing projected at the turn of the century for/U_TEMPPRED 2030 has been significantly less than would have been the case without pro-migration policy intervention, the impacts have been uneven.

At the beginning of the century it was estimated that by/U_TEMPPRED 2030 the age at which full retirement benefits start would have risen to the mid-1970s in all developed countries, while benefits for healthy pensioners would be substantially lower than their 2005 levels.

Section 2 provides a summary of the evolution of demographic trends and their territorial variation in Europe. This information has been used as the basis for the development of two scenarios with a time horizon/B_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030 the total fertility rate is barely at 1 per woman.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030 pension costs have reached 15% of GDP.
In 2030 the balance of power politically, economically and spatially is increasingly dominated by older people.

Eurostat’s prognoses concurred with predictions for the period up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2030 that three quarters of all European regions would have no alternative to immigration as a primary growth factor.

Across EU territory as a whole though, two trends became apparent by/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

However, by/U_TEMPPRED 2020, a reduction in the participation of younger women in the work force was balanced by an increase in the labour activity rate of immigrant and older workers.

In Poland and Hungary, the metropolitan regions of Warsaw, Poznan, Krakow and Budapest showed population gains by/U_TEMPPRED 2030, but other regions shed populations.

Following this analysis the predicted continued growth of the Turkish population (World Bank forecasts expect this to exceed 100 million by/U_TEMPPRED 2050) would be sufficient to ‘cover the predicted 12 million person population deficit expected within the EU.

Certainly social and cultural changes have not been entirely negative, as the increase in contact between countries of origin and Europe has stimulated cultural expansion and exchange as re-emigration and movement of Europeans has grown and become progressively the norm by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

Looking further into the future, by/U_TEMPPRED 2045 the range could extend between 25.6 and 32.5 years around a base case of 28.8 years.

Looking further into the future, by/U_TEMPPRED 2045 the range could extend between 20.5 and 30.0 years around a base case of 24.6 years.

Trends in these parameters are then fitted and extrapolated to enable projections of life expectancy up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 40 years into the future.

Accurately predicting remaining life expectancy is a challenging exercise, not least because forecasts of up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 50 years ahead may be required.

The necessary time/B_TEMPPRED period/M_TEMPPRED is/E_TEMPPRED 337 years for the Congo, 219 years for Yemen, 129 years for Syria, and 128 years for Ghana, 32.6 years for China, 59 years for India, 33.6 years for Russia, and 45.7 years for Turkey to catch up to the present per capita level of Norway.

The necessary /B_TEMPPRED period/M_TEMPPRED is/E_TEMPPRED 374 years for the Congo, 241.4 years for Yemen, 135.3 years for Syria, and 131.6 years for Ghana, 31.2 years for China, 58.1 years for India, 31.1 years for Russia and 43.4 years for Turkey to catch up to the present per capita level of USA.

It/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 130 years for the Congo, 203.9 years for Eritrea, 81.5 years for Yemen, 69 years for Ghana, and 52.2 years for Egypt to reach the current average level of per capita income in Norway.

It/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 37.5 years for India, 51.3 years for Indonesia, 50 years for Nigeria and Pakistan and 23.3 years for Turkey to reach the current average level of per capita income in USA.

It/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 16 years for Kazakhstan, 18 years for Russia, and 22.5 years for China to reach current per capita income level of the USA.

It/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 130 years for the Congo, 203 years for Eritrea and 103 years for low-income countries to reach to the current average per capita income of Norway.

Table 1demonstrates that it/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 60.7 years for Sub-Saharan Africa, 37.7 years for South Asia and 30 years for middle- income countries to reach the current average level of per capita income in high-income countries.

It/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 118 years for Sub-Saharan African countries and 337 years for the Congo to eliminate the existing gap between themselves and high-income countries.

For China to catch up to the income level of Norway by/U_TEMPPRED 2020, it needs to grow 15 percent each year.

Table 4 illustrates that it/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 103 years and 118 years, respectively, to eliminate the existing gap between low- income countries and Sub-Saharan Africa and high-income countries.

It/B_TEMPPRED would/M_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 61 years for Sub-Saharan African countries, and approximately 60 years for low-income countries to reach the current per capita income level of the high-income countries.

In order to equalize per capita incomes by/U_TEMPPRED 2020, the low-income countries need to grow at 20 percent level on average each year.

Conclusion The convergence prediction of neoclassical theory may/B_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 100 years or more.

To prevent the per capita income gap from becoming greater by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020, the low-income country group needs to grow at the 14.75 level.

To equalize the overall per capita income levels of high and low-income countries from now until/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020, the latter group would have to grow 20 percent.

The Congo would reach the current per capita income level of the USA after 126 years, but after/U_TEMPPRED 126 years the per capita income level of the USA could reach 1.5 million USD, if the same average growth rate is reached.

In all scenarios it is assumed that countries will continue to grow at the same growth rate that they had between the years 2000 and 2007 till/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

Finally in the fourth scenario, the answer of ‘‘how fast would the underdeveloped countries have to grow merely to prevent the absolute per capita income gap between rich and underdeveloped countries from becoming greater by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020 than now’’ is given.

To prevent the absolute per capita income gap between high income and low-income countries from becoming greater by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020, the second group should grow at Table 8 Results of the third scenario for selected countries versus Norway.

To prevent the absolute per capita income gap from becoming greater by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020, Sierra Leone should grow 21.59 percent, Yemen should grow at 14.75 percent, Uzbekistan should grow 14.22, and Pakistan should grow 13.57 percent.

To prevent the absolute per capita income gap from becoming greater by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020, Congo should grow at a rate of the 27 percent, Ethiopia should grow at 20.96 percent, Ghana should grow at 17.87 percent and India should grow at 13.90 percent.

here gives the growth rate that would have to be achieved to prevent the present income gap from wider in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020.

Tables 7–9, reveal how fast underdeveloped countries would have to grow from now until/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020 for per capita income to be equalized by 2020.Table 7shows the results for the country groups,Table 8for the selected countries versus Norway, andTable 9for the selected countries versus USA.

Tables 10–12, show how fast underdeveloped countries have to grow to prevent the absolute per capita income gap between rich and underdeveloped countries from becoming greater by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020 than it is now.Table 10shows the results for the country groups,Table 11for the selected countries versus Norway, andTable 12for the selected countries versus USA.

The list of the variables used in this study is as follows: S¼Pð1þRÞ n Pis the principal sum;Sis the sum to which the principal grows at an annual rate of growth,r, overnyears;nis the number of years;Ris the growth rate of per capita income; YDT is the current per capita income level of developed countries in USD; YDCT is the current per capita income level of underdeveloped countries in USD; RD is the per capita income growth rate in developed countries from the year 2000 to 2020 (the average actual growth rate of per capita income between 2000 and 2007 is used); RDC is the per capita income growth rate in underdeveloped countries from the year 2000 to/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

In the third scenario ‘‘how fast any country or the underdeveloped countries would have to grow for per capita income to be equalized with that of the developed countries by/U_TEMPPRED 2020’’ is discussed.

In order to discuss the third and fourth scenarios, first the expected per capita income levels of countries in/U_TEMPPRED 2020 are calculated.

If the countries continue their existing average growth rates, the expected per capita income level for the high- income group countries will be 58 010 USD in/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

By this method, the/B_TEMPPRED expected/E_TEMPPRED 2020 per capita income level of Norway will be 87 977 USD, and the expected 2020 per capita income level of the USA will be 78 117 USD.

In order to equalize per capita incomes by/U_TEMPPRED 2020, the low-income countries would need to grow at a rate of 20.1 percent and middle-income countries 12.1 percent, Sub-Saharan African countries at a rate of 18.7, South Asia countries at 16.9 Table 3 Results of the first scenario for selected countries versus USA.

In order to catch up to the per capita income level of Norway by/U_TEMPPRED 2020, the required annual average growth rates would have to be 33 percent for the Congo Democratic Republic, Table 5 Results of the second scenario for selected countries versus Norway.

In order to catch up to the per capita income level of USA by/U_TEMPPRED 2020, the required annual average growth rates would have to be 32.3 percent for the Congo, 28.5 percent for Eritrea, 25.9 percent for Ethiopia, 22.6 percent for Ghana, 18.2 percent for India, and 27 percent for Sierra Leone.

We anticipate that it will be held by/U_TEMPPRED 2020

The/B_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 50 years for Malaysia: an inquiry using alternative futures methods’’ focus on ‘four developments that have taken place in Malaysia concerning attempts at looking to alternative futures for the country’.

The translation of the full title of the project in English is the Pilot Foresight for Most Appropriate Technologies for Iran in/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

To produce a number of scenarios concerning the most appropriate technologies for Iran in/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

The questionnaire had to identify major fields or areas of scientific and technological developments within the realm of physical sciences and engineering in/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

Furthermore, it had to specify the most important topics within each field or area which had the greatest chances of being turned into a dominant trend by/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

In particular, we present an analysis of an ongoing and comprehensive foresight project whose objective is to provide Iranian top decision makers with a set of scenarios concerning future developments in a number of areas of science and technology until/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

The overall responsibility of these project with one of the co-authors of this paper (Shoraka) the other co-author is involved in two of these projects, namely the socio-political and ethical impact of converging sciences and technologies (nano, bio, info and cogno) on Iran in/U_TEMPPRED 2025 (which is part of the project on Science and Technology) and also the tenth project from the above list.

The diffusion of investment capital within the urban system results in a natural reduction of gradients, and by knowing the macrolaws for the evolution of the system our visibility can be extended 150 years intoB_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED future/E_TEMPPRED.

Finally futures research is described as an evolutionary science, which will possibly become integrated within complexity science by/U_TEMPPRED 2050.

Based upon current trends it can be reasonably assumed that futures research is being penetrated by complexity scientists at a rate of 300–350 per annum, so that by/U_TEMPPRED 2025 we may find a decline in the number of futures researchers from 20,000 to 15,000, and a new generation of 7000 complexity scientists working on policy analysis.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2050, it may be expected that complexity science becomes the dominant futures research discipline, with perhaps 15,000 complexity scientists and only 10,000 futures researchers.

After more than a decade of chaotic re-structuring and re-organisation in the new context, Europe was, by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030, progressively adapting to new forms of living and working.

These required however significant investments and their impact became really substantial by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2015.

The territorial image of Europe by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030 was again quite different from what it was in 2015.

The first scenario ‘‘Europe in a context of high energy price’’ assumes that the process of oil peaking will not take place before/U_TEMPPRED 2030, but that oil price increase will nevertheless be sustained and substantial until then.

New technologies making possible the production of large energy quantities at cheap price will not have become mature before/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

It is however assumed that the oil peaking process will not take place before/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

During the whole period up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2030, the definition and implementation of new strategies in the energy sector has been confronted with controversial environmental issues.

On the contrary, in terms of global CO 2 emissions, the situation in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 has strongly worsened.

Up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2020, the rate of decline was modest.

Production decline accelerated then, to reach 55 million b/d in 2030, while the world economy could have absorbed 90 million b/d.

After/U_TEMPPRED 2020, the steady degradation of the quality of oil produced could be observed in almost all regions having passed the peak and posed additional challenges for the existing downstream infrastructures, in particular refineries.

Up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2020, natural gas was substituted to oil as a primary energy source in a number of uses such as domestic and office heating, power plants, petrochemical industries and partly transportation (buses, lorries, etc.).

The peaking of gas production did not occur globally before/U_TEMPPRED 2025, but numerous individual large gas fields had peaked earlier.

Positive feedback involving changes in human population (H) and energy demand/acquisition (Q) amplify changes in sustainability on a timescale of up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 100 years; within the anthroposphere, population increase causes more energy demand, whichin turn promotes mankind survival (sustainability).

Covering a period up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2030, the ESPON scenarios have a very limited time span compared to other climate change scenarios.

Confining the time horizon/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2030 also increased the relevance of strategies geared towards adaptation vis-a ` -vis mitigation strategies since the latter will only become noticeable in the very long term.

Any extreme climate fluctuations before/U_TEMPPRED 2030 would be rather unrealistic.

As a result, the world nations are not able to reduce emission rates by/U_TEMPPRED 2030, and adaptation policies are not prominent on the EU agenda.

As a result, a drastic cut in emission rates is reached by/U_TEMPPRED 2030, even at the expense of some economic growth.

The negative territorial impacts of climate change are at least alleviated by/U_TEMPPRED 2030

The carbon permit price was steadily increased to EUR 65/t CO 2 by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

A territorial view on Europe by/U_TEMPPRED 2030 The choice for a firm mitigation policy had had a drawback in macro-economic terms, since the costs of all mitigation measures mounted to 0.4% of EU GDP by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

As/U_TEMPPRED 2020 approached, it was clear that ongoing energy saving measures were rather successful.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2020, the intensity of damage generated by climate change had reached such levels that national governments could not cope with the numerous requests for subsidies to finance repair works and to compensate for the loss of farmers’ revenue.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030, mitigation measures taken so far proved to be too small to make a difference.

Climate scientists agreed that a temperature rise of 48C by/U_TEMPPRED 2100 was now inevitable, even if drastic measures were to be put in place before 2050.

Climate change impacts across Europe until/U_TEMPPRED 2030 Up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2030, temperatures continued to rise and growing seasons continued to shift and expand.

A territorial view on Europe by/U_TEMPPRED 2030 Looking at Europe as whole, macro-economic impacts of mitigation measures were negligible, since only cost-effective measures were put in place (of course the costs of new measures towards 2050, needed to prevent a catastrophic climate change towards/U_TEMPPRED 2100, would be huge).

Decreasing snow cover led to declining winter tourism; by/U_TEMPPRED 2030, there were no more ski resorts below 1500 m in the Alps.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2020 Break on further enlargement (except Bulgaria and Romania) Romania, Bulgaria in 2007 Turkey by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

Only lip service to neighbourhood policyWestern Balkan, EFTA/EEA countries in 2015 Continued combination of deepening and widening Turkey in /U_TEMPPRED2020 Strengthening of the neighbourhood policy (Maghreb, Ukraine, Russia, etc.) All scenarios have the time horizon/B_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED 2030 and are told from the point of view of the observer situated in that year and looking back at the evolution from 2005 onwards.

As mentioned in the paper by Dammers in this same issue, the scenarios were then constructed as a combination of qualitative and quantitative elements, resulting in qualitative scenarios with quantitative support, with a time horizon/B_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

This was then translated into more concrete elements of a territorial image of/U_TEMPPRED 2030, as the expression of the materialisation of the selected policy objectives.


Socio-cultural sectorSocio-cultural sectorSocio-cultural sector Heterogeneous and insufficient policies related to integration Promotion of regional and European identities Reactive management of social problems in large cities Growing ethnic, religious and social tensionsProactive socio-cultural integration policies, in particular in cities Increase of surveillance and security systems Increased fiscal and/or social investment in quality of life issues GovernanceGovernanceGovernance Increasing cooperation between cross-border regions Active multi-level territorial governance, particularly in areas supported by structural funds Abolishment of barriers to cross-border cooperation Increase in multi-level and cross-sectoral approaches, but limited to specific programmes (rural development); Strong role of public actors in territorial governance Less public intervention Stronger role for the European Commission Wider application of the Open Method of Coordination Increased role of private sector in decision making Climate changeClimate changeClimate change Moderate overall climate change until/U_TEMPPRED 2030 (+18) Constant emission levelsConstant to increasing emission levels Increase in extreme local eventsStrict mitigation measures (taxes, road pricing as far as non detrimental to peripheral regions) Mitigation measures based on flexible schemes and stimulation of alternative technologies.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030, other territorial developments began to emerge.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030, population ageing had produced some strains on the labour market, particularly in East Europe, but also in Italy and parts of the Iberian Peninsula.

New labour markets became available with the accession of the Balkan states in/U_TEMPPRED 2020 and Turkey in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

1illustrates the attraction and polarisation of metropolitan areas in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030 more long-term territorial effects became apparent.

2reveals a less concentrated, but more widespread pattern regarding the attraction and polarisation potential of metropolitan areas in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030 more structural changes had become apparent.

3shows, by/U_TEMPPRED 2030 the attraction and polarisation potential of metropolitan areas is powerfully concentrated in the traditional pentagon.

Although the external competition of emerging economies takes place, by/U_TEMPPRED 2030, increasingly through innovation, know-how and technologies, the European economy has reached a sufficient level of competitiveness to increase its share in the strongly growing external markets.

Europe in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 is well-connected by a clean and efficient multimodal system, the envy of the world.

Any action against climate change or for the tapping of new energy sources will almost inevitably create effects only after/U_TEMPPRED 2030, the time horizon set for the scenarios.

Expectations regarding the future The questionnaire was also extended to include the likely change of financial status and expectations of happiness in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 10 years.

Members of this group predominantly think that they would not be alive in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 10 years, despite the fact that many of them were relatively young.

Questions concerning financial status were extended to look at changes both at individual and family level, among friends and the wider Hungarian population, in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED coming/E_TEMPPRED 10 years.

Actions for the future Our questions concerning actions taken to improve the future were focusing on what the respondents were doing to achieve a better and happier life in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 10 years.

In/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED following/E_TEMPPRED 30 years, the arable was extended somewhat but the major change was in the ownership structure: in the 1930s, the land was owned by the farms creating an intricate property pattern in the landscape.

Vision/B_TEMPPRED for/M_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED future/E_TEMPPRED Ten years into the rapid areal growth of the capital city the market has slowed and a partly enforced pause in launching further construction may provide a chance for the landscape surrounding Tallinn to settle .At the moment, the new housing developments – eclectic or fully designed – south of the city look uniformly raw and ugly.

These are things we can only discover 10, 20 years from/B_TEMPPRED now/E_TEMPPRED.

Participants as characters The FFP scenarios were set in/U_TEMPPRED 2050 and presented from that point of view, describing the state of the world and the events throughout the first half of the 21st century.

3 Written similar to other qualitative scenarios[33,34], the narratives described events in, and leading up to, the/B_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2050.

The FFP was a nation-wide scenario-based policy exercise to develop and analyze scenarios of possible states of Canada’s forests and forest sector in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2050.

These participants felt the scenarios may have been more engaging if written as short fiction, or, for example, from the perspective of a specific, identifiable character such as a retired forester reflecting on life up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2050.

By reading them as though/U_TEMPPRED 2050 were the present tense, people had to situate themselves in that time.

So rather than saying, ‘this might happen in/U_TEMPPRED 2050,’ you say, ‘this has happened’’’ (Participant 05)

When describing how they dealt with the fact that the scenarios were crafted as though/U_TEMPPRED 2050 was the present, participants made comments like: ‘‘We all did our best to try and look at it as, ‘o.k

Another participant explained that she dealt with it by pretending she took a time machine to/U_TEMPPRED 2050 and was living at that point in the future (Participant 12)

So they’re still thinking, ‘hey it’s me that’s going to be impacted’’’ (Participant02).Almost a third of the interviewees referred specifically to their own lives, and calculated their approximate age in/U_TEMPPRED 2050, imagining what they might be doing.

The raw power of financial systems is exposed by the observation that in a global financial crisis that will/B_TEMPPRED take/E_TEMPPRED 10 year to repair, the people and institutions that caused the crises continue to be unfeasibly rewarded.

In the final part, the conversation partner was asked to formulate a desirable and plausible future for Brussels in/U_TEMPPRED 2035.

On the day, the parade included floats depicting 2058 as well as/U_TEMPPRED 2250.

First, to enrich the long-term municipality plan with a desired vision of the community in/U_TEMPPRED 2020; and second to enable young people between 14 and 19 years old to contribute their ideas to the vision.

The project was coined ‘Visions, Values and Goals for our Municipality in/U_TEMPPRED 2020’.

Therefore, the ideas needed to be developed into short stories, which should show desired descriptions of Lundal in/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

In the USA, for example, the number of people with diabetes will rise from 24 million to 44 million people by/U_TEMPPRED 2034 if current trends continue and the cost will triple from $113 billion annually to $336 billion annually[4]

In India, the share of deaths from chronic disease is expected to increase from 40% in 1990 to 67% in/U_TEMPPRED 2020, and spending on cardiac-related treatments is expected to grow annually by 13%’’.

For example, longer life spans will lead to a doubling of the world population with dementia and alzheimer’s, from 35 million to 65 million by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

As for decision-makers, the extent to which the territorial image of Europe in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 is more likely to be the result of a Wild Card (whatever it appears to be) than of the well-crafted policies developed during the same period is interesting to reflect upon.

The dollar thus loses its status as the reserve currency and the rest of the world invests in the Euro, which thus becomes thede factoreserve currency by/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

Indeed, the project developed strategic prospective scenarios for the future development of the European territory, especially in the light of the ESDP and European Union (EU) cohesion policy, at the horizon/B_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

Confronted by this vicious cycle, mixing the effects of weak demographic development, political manoeuvring, fiscal crisis and economic recession, by/U_TEMPPRED 2022, European leaders declare the European social model ‘bankrupt’, halting almost all but the most basic social redistributions.

The transport and energy policies followed up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 2022 would simply magnify the effect produced by the Wild Card.

It is however unlikely that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe would have ‘caught up’ by/U_TEMPPRED 2022 (perhaps with the exception of a few capital regions and high-tech enclaves), while the sudden withdrawal of the fiscal and institutional ‘safety blanket’ from many traditional lagging regions may actually see them suffer even more egregiously than would have been the case if a managed process had been acted upon sooner.

For instance, as noted by Greeuw et al.[15], the POSSUM team[42], in formulating sustainable transport goals for/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020, seems to have treated Europe as an isolated continent.

Accordingly, building scenarios for Yalova in/U_TEMPPRED 2020 benefited from the larger-scale scenarios already developed and tested

European Commission (EC-DGXVII), Energy in Europe: European Energy to/U_TEMPPRED 2020: A Scenario Approach, European Commission, Luxembourg, 1996.

Delta Scan, a project for the British government’s Horizon Scanning Centre, collected over a hundred long forecasts on the future of science and technology to/U_TEMPPRED 2050.

The advantage here is with open source, and my forecast is that platform-independent, flexible systems will see considerable growth, with a good proportion, possibly half or more based on open source components by/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

I anticipate that by/U_TEMPPRED 2020 roughly 30% of any segment of activity that can be called ‘‘infrastructure’’ will be open source, such as server and client tools, office applications, utilities and operating systems.

In principle, all TEN projects (Trans-European Network) were expected to be completed by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020, but given the slow evolution of infrastructure investments, additional hypotheses were used to define which links would be built.

Each scenario concluded with a final image of Europe in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 (the time horizon of the scenarios).

The time/B_TEMPPRED horizon/M_TEMPPRED was/E_TEMPPRED 2030 and the geographic scope pan-European.

Eurostat predicts that, under normal conditions, the EU-27’s population will rise to around 496 million persons in/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

But how to treat individuals who turned to the health care system with no other evidence than the results of a commercial genetic test? In/U_TEMPPRED 2022, a twenty-eight year young woman, who had consulted her doctor after having learnt about her risk for diabetes from a commercial genetic test, filed a complaint against her health insurer for denying her reimbursement of subsequent counselling and monitoring.

If there were other indications for being at risk, like a family history, individuals could be included in the preventive diabetes programme, which by now (from/U_TEMPPRED 2020) had acquired a national status and was covered by all health insurers.

Consequently, climate scientists estimate the average temperature in North-western Europe to decrease by 38C in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 15 years.

20% emissions reduction by/U_TEMPPRED 2020) influences the behavior of actors such as companies which introduce their own emission reduction targets, or CO 2 reduction initiatives.

These ongoing scans look ahead over a range of up/B_TEMPPRED to/E_TEMPPRED 50 years to uncover ‘‘contradictions and ambiguities in mapping the turbulence of change’’.

Four scenarios are developed for/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

The Institute also recognises the value of a vision of the future for ‘‘euroatlantic global society’’[4]and it is preparing an ‘‘integrated metavision for/U_TEMPPRED 2050–2100’’ which ‘‘will be a sacral (spiritual, transcendent) world’.

Ledos, Brittany: agricultural and agri-food products in/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

Iran has not started substantial production (has no export), but is assumed to become important exporter by/B_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

Long run and very long run future for gas demand Let us start from middle term forecasts (by/B_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030).

OPEC predicts that by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030, world share of renewable will still remain below 10%, with 24.4% of natural gas in energy portfolio.

EU has quite ambitious program 20-20-20 to use 20% of renewable energy by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020 and to have similar energy saving.

For example Algeria may be a supplier of equal magnitude say as Russia but then only for a period of about/U_TEMPPRED 10 years.

Some publications in US press revealed the fact about substantial increase of production of shale gas that may turn US from net gas importer into exporter into next/U_TEMPPRED decade.
The General Scheme of Gas Sector Developmentin Russia (quoted in[14]) suggests that in/B_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030 the major replacementof depleted fieldswillcome fromYamal and other fields in Western Siberia (up to 260 bcm).

It has two strategic choices: (a) When to peak (most likely narrow choice between/U_TEMPPRED 2040 and/U_TEMPPRED 2050, based also on strategic considerations); in the first case its maximal export can reach 400 bcm but will last for fewer decades, (b) The long term LNG capacity (most likely, the choice between 50 and 100 bcm)

Gas production at Iran’s offshore natural gas field South Pars will rise to 175 Mcm per day within the next/U_TEMPPRED 2 years.

The development of gas in Eastern Siberia and Far East is planned to go with comparable increments each year between/U_TEMPPRED 2010 and/U_TEMPPRED 2030, but it might go faster after 2015.

EIA projects that renewable energy will account for approximately 11% of total energy consumption in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

Even in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030, renewable energy is not expected to make up a very large fraction of overall energy usage.

Under this scenario, renewable energy should be able to account for 15–25% of total energy demand by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

Some estimates put the cost of holding carbon dioxide emissions at 500 ppm at around 2% of global GDP per year over a period/B_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED 50 year.

The IEA’s [17] 450 scenario puts renewable energy (biomass and waste, other, hydro) at 22% of total energy demand in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

The peaks in coal, oil/natural gas, and energy efficiency are spaced apart by/B_TEMPPRED about/E_TEMPPRED 50 years.

EIA [49] and IEA [17] projections, scenario 1 should be able to achieve renewable energy consumption of between 10% and 20% of total energy demand in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

In comparison, the IEA [17] estimates that renewable energy will account for approximately 14% of total energy consumption in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030 [17] which is not too different from the IEA’s estimate of a 12.6% share of total energy demand that renewable energy accounted for in 2007.

In the IEA’s 450 energy scenario, a scenario in which government policies currently being discussed to address issues of climate change and energy security are actually implemented with the effect of limiting carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere at 450 ppm, the demand for renewable energy is expected to grow by 10.4% per year between/U_TEMPPRED 2007 and/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

In fact the IEA now expects global oil production to peak around/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

According to official estimates, the pipe grid will be extended by 11% in the first years and by 20–23% as of/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

In/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED decade, other ongoing projects will serve to very significantly reduce gas flow through the centre of the European continent.

In this case, the increase in gas production through two next/U_TEMPPRED decades will most likely be lower than forecast by the government.

This discount will be only partially offset by higher domestic prices, thus reducing Gazprom’s financial capacity to lead several simultaneous large projects over the next/U_TEMPPRED decade.

In December 2009, Russia and Turkmenistan have reached a new agreement for trading 30 bcm annually over the next/U_TEMPPRED three years.

Thus, government figures posit that the gas sold abroad from Russia will grow by 40% in twenty years, from 270 bcm in 2008 to 370 bcm in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

The increase would be minimal in the early years and grow at a faster rate between 2015 and 2030, so that the average annual rate over the whole period (2008–2030) would range between 1.38% and 1.69%, resulting in an export increase of about 85 bcm, from 205 bcm in 2008 to 290 bcm in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

However, despite this decline, the region will remain the main centre for global gas production in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

The Arctic coast, where fields (Yamal, Kara Sea, and Ob-Taz bay) are still untapped, would provide 40% of output by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

16 The data source for official forecasts through/U_TEMPPRED 2030 is Interfax.

It projects 135–175 bcm by 2020 and 310– 360 by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

Overall, new production regions which now provide 20 bcm would produce 350 bcm (of a total 820 bcm) in 2020, and 580 bcm (of 915 bcm) in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

As a result, sales to Europe could grow by 50–60 bcm by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

Following government forecasts, export share will tend to stabilize at around 50% from/U_TEMPPRED 2020, against an estimated national average of around 33%.

However, demand growth is almost nil and the government foresees its decline from/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

Thus, the 80 bcm currently consumed would rise to 200 bcm in/U_TEMPPRED 2020, making China a large consumer capable of formalizing important agreements with Russia, as Chinese self-reliance is limited and most domestic consumption will have to be met by imports.

Therefore, new launches are not likely to occur before/U_TEMPPRED 2020, so until this date exports to Asia will depend crucially on the development of Sakhalin-2, while the continuity of Sakhalin-1 is subject to the resolution of tensions between Gazprom and its partners in the PSA.

Thus, gas output in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 would be 860 bcm, compared to the 915 bcm expected by the government.

The most plausible forecasts put the annual growth rate of consumption between 1.4% and 1.1%, so that the absolute level in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 would range between 625 and 585 bcm.

Gas drilling may further increase through/U_TEMPPRED 2020–2030, putting into operation either some Eastern fields (Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, or Sakha) or some Northern fields (Shtokman, Ob- Taz bay, and others).

Source: Own design 29 Hartley and Medlock [21], Energy Information Administration [10], and Gromov [20] estimate that Russian gas output in/U_TEMPPRED 2030 would be 880–890 bcm.

Moreover, offshore fields in Ob-Taz bay and Kara sea are projected to start after/U_TEMPPRED 2020 and/U_TEMPPRED 2025, respectively.

Table 3 summarizes the results of four qualitative scenario studies outlining scenarios for/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2050 (in one case 2040).

This requires that the developed countries’ emissions are radically reduced during the next/U_TEMPPRED 40 years.

Contemporary low-carbon energy scenarios in perspective In this section we review and discuss 20 studies that analyze the consequences of substantial GHG emission cuts until/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED yearE_TEMPPRED 2050 and beyond.

In a majority of the studies the reduction scenarios build on the requirement that the stabilization targets must be met no later than the year 2100, but in our review we focus mainly on the implications for the energy system in/U_TEMPPRED 2050.

This requires that global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are halved during the next/U_TEMPPRED 40 years, implying in turn that the developed countries’ emissions may have to be reduced by 70–95%.

Concluding remarks Energy scenario studies provide insights on the different societal transitions implied by approaching low-carbon futures in the next/U_TEMPPRED 40 years, and in this article we have discussed how greater attention to governance issues can improve future scenario exercises.

All respondents from less than 1 year experience to more than 15 years considered that the majority of the drivers will occur between/U_TEMPPRED 2016 and 2025.
As the years of experience increased, the time horizon for the occurrence of wild cards tended to remain between/U_TEMPPRED 2016 and 2025.

Our primary conclusion is that it will be very useful to repeat the survey with FTA 2010 if possible, and extend it to other similar groups, in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED year or two, for comparison purposes.

Different from the other groups, respondents with 5–15 years experience considered that more than 50% of the discontinuities will occur with the realisation time between/U_TEMPPRED 2016 and 2025.

Respondents with no experience expected that the wild cards would occur after/U_TEMPPRED 2025, whereas the respondents with maximum 3 years of experience had a shorter time horizon.

Smith/ Futures 43 (2011) 292–312296 Recent reports about accelerated arctic ice shelf melting and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may create discontinuities in national and international policy approaches toward climate treaties design and promulgation; Advances in nanotechnology, genomics and quantum computing, if realised within the next/U_TEMPPRED decade, could fundamentally alter our ways of making materials, practicing medicine and computation-making calculations, with pervasive societal impacts.

While clearly beyond the scope of this paper, it may be revealing to pursue some scenarios development that focus on tracking many of these possible provocative trends forward to try to estimate how disruptive they might conceivably be by/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

A considerable percentage of respondents from Australasia suggested that the drivers will emerge in the short run, whereas the majority of the respondents from the EU Candidate countries assessed the time horizon for the occurrence of drivers after/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

None of the student respondents expect that the drivers will occur after/U_TEMPPRED 2025.

If this decline continues at the same rate, healthy sperm counts will be seriously low in most men within the next/U_TEMPPRED 80 years.

Space activities or energy policy require long term horizon), the finality (society visioning may require even longer time span, such as 50 years forward/U_TEMPPRED ), the stakeholders (usually a shorter horizon) or the decision-makers (electoral life span).

The second step is about imagining the future of Romanian rural communities From this starting point, the imagination work can begin: how unexpected phenomena and known trends (climate change, migrations, laicization of the society, increasing hybridization, urbanization, food crisis, knowledge-based society, etc.) can impact on this system during/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 20 years.

Yet grow is so firmly and deeply implanted in us by/U_TEMPPRED 150 years of formal education, developmental policies, economic theories, and media hype that it is almost impossible for most people easily to consider, much less to embrace, other alternatives, and thus they envision and plan for a kind of grow future that cannot be achieved, thus failing to take advantage of the challenges and opportunities that do exist in other alternatives.

‘‘What are the criteria we start from when we decide the methods?’’ A usual non-exhaustive list of criteria [8] includes the following: main goals to reach (in-depth study, participatory experience, decision-makers’ involvement, capacity building, etc.); mainly exploratory or normative (transformative) approach; time horizon (20 or 40 years ahead/U_TEMPPRED ?); limits of the studied system; main scale of the study (local, national, regional, etc.

What is the most suitable horizon? In order to convince decision-makers and to be in line with other foresight exercises in EU, 2030 seems an acceptable horizon, although/U_TEMPPRED 2040 would have been more suitable due to the inherent time dynamics of the studied system.

Two scales could be involved: a national scale with working groups of national decision-makers describing what desirable future they envision for rural communities in Romania at/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

It is notable that China has already identified the ‘Internet of Things’ as a goal to be achieved within/B_TEMPPRED/M_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED five years, under its 12th Five Year Plan.

By/U_TEMPPRED 2030, at the rate we are going, our industrial civilization will need the capacity of two planets to absorb its carbon dioxide and other wastes and provide for continued mining and exploitation of resources.

13 When we add in China’s planning system that directs finance towards favored investment, it could well have an energy system based on hydro, renewable and nuclear that generates more electric power than fossil fuels by 2030, and eclipses fossil fuels as primary energy source by/U_TEMPPRED 2050.

From the perspective/B_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED 2050, when the shift to renewables will be well under way and acquiring unstoppable momentum, the idea that we could mortgage the future of our industrial civilization to a finite resource whose exploitation made countries the pawns of those endowed by chance with supplies, and encouraged brutal dictatorships to protect it, and whose burning was effectively poisoning the planet – such an idea will appear preposterous.

Again from the perspective/B_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED 2050, when this process will be well advanced, the idea that the origin of resources could be ignored, and commodities could be produced and traded in a ‘generic’ form without regard to their origins, will be regarded as benighted.

Several visions and images were developed and a time horizon was set for the development of the future sustainable society, denoted by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2050.

The images of the future include a qualitative part that describes changes in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2050 as well as quantitative in the form of calculated amounts of transportation, energy use, and CO 2 emissions.

Scenarios on EU-27 gas supply and demand in/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

Scenarios on EU-27 gas import dependence in/U_TEMPPRED 2020 (%).

The initial capacity of 20 Bcm will be increased to 30 Bcm by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

Regarding the EU Commission; diversification of natural gas supplies is a significant decision to support European energy security given that if the EU-27 does not take appropriate measures, its dependence on Russian gas may drastically increase, which for some perspectives can reach 70% of total imports in/U_TEMPPRED 2020 and 80% in/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

These suppliers may choose defying European norms on various issues Table 4 Contingencies on European energy security in/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

Institutions In the similar way, unless we change our beliefs and values about the world at large, our political systems will be unable to introduce required institutional changes that would guide investment and consumption choices towards socially desirable 6 If we exclude CERA’s optimistic estimates of an undulating plateau between/U_TEMPPRED 2030 and 2055 year after which oil production starts declining.

They put the peak of conventional oil production before/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

For/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED forty years, urban development proved him largely correct, as highways, strip commercial centers, and bland suburbs dominated new construction.

United States Energy Information Agency Statistics Center,http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/country/country_energy_data.cfm?fips=US, In the United States, cities including buildings and transportation are responsible for seventy-five per cent of energy consumption with a baseline projection of a thirty-four percent increase by/U_TEMPPRED 2030.

Nevertheless, in the inevitable situation of nine to ten billion people in/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED middle/M_TEMPPRED of/E_TEMPPRED the century, the shift to less materialistic value orientations and corresponding consumption patterns might temporarily surpass the earth carrying capacity.

With a population increasing from 1 billion in 1800 to 6 billion in 2000 and probably over 9 billion in/U_TEMPPRED 2050 and an ever-increasing consumption level, the pressure on the earth system is increasing to more than ten-fold the level of 1800 during the coming decades.

In the left hand side globalization worldviews, the world population is expected to decline after/U_TEMPPRED 2050.

He admits that the most important trends for/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/U_TEMPPRED 50 years.

We will be able to rank everything from politicians to personal computers and by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2020 people, products and organizations will have reliability ratings.

Interestingly, he selected 5 main trends of/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED following/E_TEMPPRED 50 years at the beginning of the book but at the end of the book he also determines 5 things that would not change over/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/U_TEMPPRED 50 years.

In terms of method, the question how to investigate what is not yet there, presents the challenge of designing intellectual exercises and tools that can provide insight into the state of the world ten, twenty or fifty years from/B_TEMPPRED now/E_TEMPPRED

He admits that the most important trends for/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 50 years are: (1) ageing (demographic shift), (2) power shift (towards China, India and the Middle East), (3) global connectivity (the shift from ‘‘me’’ to ‘‘we’’), (4) GRIN technologies (genetics, robotics, internet and nanotechnology) and (5) the environment (climate change).

In this project, futurists made a distinction between the relatively short term future until/U_TEMPPRED 2020 and the longer term between/U_TEMPPRED 2020 and 2040.

Between/U_TEMPPRED 2020 and 2050 we can see trade unions; petrol engined vehicles, European Union (the author expresses his apology for this), coins, oil, free public services, Microsoft, peace and quite, blindness on this list.

On the innovation timeline side till/U_TEMPPRED 2050 we can see self-cleaning windows, synthetic skin, wearable computers, disposable phones, plastic bones, self-driving cars, global voting, smart bullets, space factories and many more on the list.

Heshows that the number of some computer game owners is more than the population of many countries. By relying on the se examples he claims that by/U_TEMPPRED 2050 Hollywood, the computer industry, neuroscience and the pharmaceutical industry will have merged into one.

The author highlights that between/U_TEMPPRED now and 2030, emission of CO 2 from China is predicted to equal that of the rest of the world combined.

In/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED quarter century, changes will be more dramatic, coinciding with the advancing development of the energy and transportation infrastructures.

Health psychology and health education In/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED decade, we are likely to see a greater fusion of health psychology with the insights provided by an understanding of evolutionary selection pressures.

Gas prices in the USA rose above $4/gal in 2008, providing hints of what will happen In/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED two decades as fuel prices rise, steadily or not.

In/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED decade, there will be increasing numbers of currently existing projects such as community gardens, which provide locally produced fresh produce, better air quality, and additional public green space.

The experience with the rate of retreat in the first decade of this century suggests that this may happen much earlier, possibly by/U_TEMPPRED 2020.

Reports like those of the IPCC[1]and the ACIA[2]have predicted that most of the sea ice will have disappeared from the Arctic Ocean in the summer time, around/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2040.

Too many people: As the world’s population grows to about 9 billion around/U_TEMPPRED 2050, global tensions will climb as a result of dropping water tables, rising and changing consumer demand, uncontrolled migratory movements, demands for equality in healthcare, pollution, famine, congestion, unemployment, poverty, disease, starvation, social violence and the like.

Train notes the Club of Rome study predicting that current population, resource use and other trends will end in disaster in/B_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED century.

The authors explicitly note that it is not a forecast, and that they do not believe the available data and theories would enable an accurate prediction of what will happen to the world over/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED century.

And Fisk points out that ‘The precipitous collapse of economic growth projected by the MIT report does not occur before/U_TEMPPRED 2020 in any of the model runs, so it is hard to see how its doomsday projections have been disproved.

The British government has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by/U_TEMPPRED 2050, a very ambitious goal.

The report argues that this amount of emissions reduction is achievable at an affordable cost of between 1% and 2% of GDP in/U_TEMPPRED 2050.’ Pielke[16] further argues that not only ‘is the Climate Change Act all but certain to fail to achieve its ambitious emissions reduction goals in both the short and long term, but that it is fundamentally flawed in its basic conception.’.

It is likely that the world will reach Hubbert’s Peak in/M_TEMPPRED the/U_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED decade or two, which is defined to be the highest amount of oil production that could ever be reached in human history.

Worldwide, fossil fuels represented at least 87% of energy consumed in 2004, a percentage that is not forecasted to change by/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED year/E_TEMPPRED 2030.

Each path from now to 1000 years into the future will be describable over a number of variables, including the number of deaths attributable to energy problems.

This paper assumes that the unsustainable energy policies at least pose very serious problems for humanity, if not extremely serious problems, over/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 1000 years.

Tonn/ Futures 43 (2011) 348–355354 It can be argued that unsustainable energy policies could lead to the deaths of millions of people over/B_TEMPPRED the/M_TEMPPRED next/E_TEMPPRED 1000 years, from the combined ravages of climate change and energy shortages.

The weight of history and the structure of the present These trends and issues are only a small part of the story; the urbanization of the planet (by/U_TEMPPRED 2050, when the vast majority of people will be living in cities), deep inequity, loss of green space, hyper-urbanization (the rise of the mega city) and the car–road worldview continue.

In his review of Davis’ work, Harding writes that the ‘‘slumization of the world’’ deserves more global attention, given that by/U_TEMPPRED 2020 half the world’s urban population will exist in poverty.

The ‘how’ of city futures To respond to these and other potential changes, many cities have embarked on/U_TEMPPRED 2030 type projects where they map possible and plausible futures and then create their desired future.

The participants wanted to begin the process of thinking about/U_TEMPPRED 2046 since they understood that climate change was a long term issue.

Multiple issues: climate change, searching for differentiation in a world economy and protecting against tourism downturns— Gold Coast City Council Another group that has taken a longer term approach is the Gold Coast City Council (focused on/U_TEMPPRED 2038).

Since the Vision’s refreshment in/B_TEMPPRED the/E_TEMPPRED 2026 project (and this is part of the pendulum swing of local politics), the focus has not been on challenging the current direction of the city but on implementing large scale infrastructure projects, such as building tunnels.

In order to calculate a default value for investment stock in the future, an assessment needs to be made of the total settlement costs in/U_TEMPPRED 2025 and 2150 on the assumption that the urban and rural housing planning standards are achieved.
As the proportion of the urban population is expected to increase from say 60% to 90% in the period from/U_TEMPPRED 2025 to/U_TEMPPRED 2150, the rural settlement factor becomes of diminishing importance.
