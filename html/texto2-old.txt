the O

is O
some O
40% O
higher O
than O
at O
the O

By U_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
Switzerland O
had O
one O

the O
highest O

foreign O

in O
Europe, O
as O
it O
did O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
century.
The O
net O
result O
is O
that O
the O
total O
population, O
82 O
million O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
century, O
has O
declined O
to O
71.5 O
million O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
Here, O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
people O
over O
65 O
accounted O
for O
almost O
half O
the O

with O
one-fifth O
at O
the O
beginning O

the O

In O
the O
UK O
for O
instance, O
compared O
with O
the O
300 O
people O
aged O
100+ O
in O
1950, O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
expectation O
that O
living O
for O
a O
century O
will O
be O
the O
norm O
for O
thousands O
of O
people.
However, O
a O
previous O
lack O
of O
regulation O
of O
internal O
movements O
has O
meant O
that O
although O
the O
extent O
of O
population O
decline O
and O
ageing O
projected O
at O
the O
turn O
of O
the O

has O

less O
than O
would O
have O
been O
the O
case O
without O
pro-migration O

the O

have O
been O
uneven.
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

it O
was O
estimated O
that O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
the O
age O
at O

risen O
to O
the O
mid-1970s O
in O
all O
developed O

while O

be O
substantially O

Section O

provides O
a O
summary O
of O
the O
evolution O
of O
demographic O
trends O
and O
their O
territorial O
variation O
in O
Europe. O
This O
information O
has O
been O
used O
as O
the O
basis O
for O
the O
development O
of O
two O
scenarios O
with O
a O
time O
horizon B_TEMPPRED O
of E_TEMPPRED O
2030.
By U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
the O
total O
fertility O
rate O
is O
barely O
at O
1 O
per O
woman.
By U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
pension O
costs O
have O
reached O
15% O
of O
GDP.
In O
2030 O
the O
balance O
of O
power O
politically, O
economically O
and O
spatially O
is O
increasingly O
dominated O
by O
older O
people.
Eurostat’s O
prognoses O
concurred O
with O
predictions O
for O
the O
period O
up B_TEMPPRED O
to E_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
that O
three O
quarters O
of O
all O
European O
regions O
would O
have O
no O
alternative O
to O
immigration O
as O
a O
primary O
growth O
factor.
Across O
EU O
territory O
as O
a O
whole O
though, O
two O
trends O
became O
apparent O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2020.
However, O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
participation O
of O
younger O
women O
in O
the O
work O
force O
was O
balanced O
by O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
labour O
activity O
rate O
of O
immigrant O
and O
older O
workers.
In O
Poland O
and O
Hungary, O
the O
metropolitan O
regions O
of O
Warsaw, O
Poznan, O
Krakow O
and O
Budapest O
showed O
population O
gains O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
but O
other O
regions O
shed O
populations.
Following O
this O
analysis O
the O
predicted O
continued O
growth O
of O
the O
Turkish O
population O
(World O
Bank O
forecasts O
expect O
this O
to O
exceed O
100 O
million O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2050) O
would O
be O
sufficient O
to O
‘cover O
the O
predicted O
12 O
million O
person O
population O
deficit O
expected O
within O
the O
EU.
Certainly O
social O
and O
cultural O
changes O
have O
not O
been O
entirely O
negative, O
as O
the O
increase O
in O
contact O
between O
countries O
of O
origin O
and O
Europe O
has O
stimulated O
cultural O
expansion O
and O
exchange O
as O
re-emigration O
and O
movement O
of O
Europeans O
has O
grown O
and O
become O
progressively O
the O
norm O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
Looking O
further O
into O
the O
future, O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2045 O
the O
range O
could O
extend O
between O
25.6 O
and O
32.5 O

around O
a O

by U_TEMPPRED O

In O

we O
present O
an O

of O
an O
ongoing O

(which O

and O
also O
the O

from O
the O

The O
diffusion O

within O

results O
in O
a O

by O

Finally O
futures O

is O
described O
as O
an O
evolutionary O
science, O
which O
will O
possibly O
become O
integrated O
within O
complexity O
science O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2050.
Based O
upon O
current O
trends O
it O
can O
be O
reasonably O
assumed O
that O
futures O
research O
is O
being O
penetrated O
by O
complexity O
scientists O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
300–350 O
per O
annum, O
so O
that O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2025 O
we O
may O
find O
a O
decline O
in O
the O
number O
of O
futures O
researchers O
from O
20,000 O

15,000, O
and O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
7000 O
complexity O
scientists O
working O
on O
policy O
analysis.
By U_TEMPPRED O
2050, O
it O
may O
be O
expected O
that O
complexity O
science O
becomes O
the O
dominant O
futures O
research O
discipline, O
with O
perhaps O
15,000 O
complexity O
scientists O
and O
only O
10,000 O

After O
more O
than O
a O
decade O
of O
chaotic O
re-structuring O

in O
the O
new O

Europe O

by B_TEMPPRED O

progressively O

These O
required O
however O
significant O

their O

became O
really O

The O
territorial O
image O
of O
Europe O
by B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O

2030 O
was O
again O
quite O
different O
from O
what O
it O
was O
in O
2015.
The O
first O
scenario O
‘‘Europe O
in O
a O
context O
of O

assumes O
that O
the O
process O
of O

will O
not O
take O

before U_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
but O
that O

increase O
will O
nevertheless O
be O
sustained O
and O
substantial O
until O
then.
New O

making O
possible O
the O
production O
of O
large O

quantities O
at O
cheap O

will O
not O
have O
become O
mature O
before U_TEMPPRED O

It O
is O
however O
assumed O
that O
the O
oil O
peaking O
process O
will O
not O
take O
place O
before U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
During O
the O
whole O
period O
up B_TEMPPRED O
to E_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
the O
definition O
and O
implementation O
of O
new O
strategies O
in O
the O
energy O
sector O
has O
been O
confronted O
with O
controversial O
environmental O
issues.
On O
the O
contrary, O
in O
terms O
of O
global O
CO O
2 O
emissions, O
the O
situation O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
has O
strongly O
worsened.
Up B_TEMPPRED O
to E_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
the O
rate O
of O
decline O
was O
modest.
Production O

accelerated O
then, O
to O
reach O
55 O

2030, O

After U_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
the O
steady O
degradation O
of O
the O
quality O
of O
oil O
produced O
could O
be O
observed O
in O
almost O
all O
regions O
having O
passed O
the O
peak O
and O
posed O
additional O
challenges O
for O
the O
existing O
downstream O
infrastructures, O
in O
particular O
refineries.
Up B_TEMPPRED O
to E_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
natural O
gas O
was O
substituted O
to O

The O
peaking O
of O

did O
not O
occur O
globally O
before U_TEMPPRED O

Covering O

up B_TEMPPRED O

the O

have O
a O
very O
limited O

Confining O
the O
time O

2030 O
also O
increased O
the O

strategies O

Any O
extreme O
climate O

before U_TEMPPRED O

would O
be O
rather O
unrealistic.
As O
a O
result, O
the O
world O
nations O
are O
not O
able O
to O
reduce O
emission O
rates O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
and O

As O

result, O
a O

in O

is O
reached O
by U_TEMPPRED O

even O
at O

The O
choice O
for O
a O

had O
had O
a O
drawback O
in O
macro-economic O

since O
the O

mounted O
to O
0.4% O

by U_TEMPPRED O

As U_TEMPPRED O
2020 O
approached, O
it O
was O
clear O
that O
ongoing O
energy O

were O
rather O
successful.
By U_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
the O
intensity O
of O

had O
reached O
such O

By U_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
mitigation O
measures O
taken O
so O
far O
proved O
to O
be O
too O
small O
to O
make O
a O

the O
major O

was O
in O
the O

in O
the O

the O

were O
set O
in U_TEMPPRED O

and O
presented O
from O

view, O
describing O
the O
state O
of O
the O
world O
and O
the O
events O
throughout O
the O

half O

described O
events O
in, O
and O
leading O
up O
to, O
the B_TEMPPRED O
year E_TEMPPRED O
2050.
The O
FFP O
was O
a O
nation-wide O
scenario-based O
policy O
exercise O
to O
develop O
and O
analyze O
scenarios O
of O
possible O
states O
of O
Canada’s O
forests O
and O
forest O
sector O
in B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O
year E_TEMPPRED O
2050.
These O
participants O
felt O
the O
scenarios O
may O
have O
been O
more O
engaging O
if O
written O
as O
short O
fiction, O
or, O
for O
example, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
a O
specific, O
identifiable O
character O
such O
as O
a O
retired O
forester O
reflecting O
on O
life O
up B_TEMPPRED O
to E_TEMPPRED O
2050.
By O
reading O
them O
as O
though U_TEMPPRED O
2050 O
were O
the O
present O
tense, O
people O
had O
to O
situate O
themselves O
in O
that O
time.
So O
rather O
than O
saying, O
‘this O
might O
happen O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2050,’ O
you O
say, O
‘this O
has O
happened’’’ O
(Participant O
05)
When O
describing O
how O
they O
dealt O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
scenarios O
were O
crafted O
as O
though U_TEMPPRED O
2050 O
was O
the O
present, O
participants O
made O
comments O
like: O
‘‘We O
all O
did O
our O
best O
to O
try O
and O
look O
at O
it O
as, O
‘o.k
Another O
participant O
explained O
that O
she O
dealt O
with O
it O
by O
pretending O
she O
took O
a O
time O
machine O
to U_TEMPPRED O
2050 O
and O
was O
living O
at O
that O
point O
in O
the O
future O
(Participant O
12)
So O
they’re O
still O
thinking, O
‘hey O
it’s O
me O
that’s O
going O
to O
be O
impacted’’’ O
(Participant02).Almost O
a O
third O
of O
the O
interviewees O
referred O
specifically O
to O
their O
own O
lives, O
and O
calculated O
their O
approximate O
age O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2050, O
imagining O
what O
they O
might O
be O
doing.
The O
raw O
power O
of O
financial O
systems O
is O
exposed O
by O
the O
observation O
that O
in O
a O
global O
financial O
crisis O
that O
will B_TEMPPRED O
take E_TEMPPRED O
10 O
year O
to O
repair, O
the O
people O
and O
institutions O
that O
caused O
the O
crises O
continue O
to O
be O
unfeasibly O
rewarded.
In O
the O
final O
part, O
the O
conversation O
partner O
was O
asked O
to O
formulate O
a O
desirable O
and O
plausible O
future O
for O
Brussels O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2035.
On O
the O
day, O
the O
parade O
included O
floats O
depicting O
2058 O
as O
well O
as U_TEMPPRED O
2250.
First, O
to O
enrich O
the O
long-term O
municipality O
plan O
with O
a O
desired O
vision O
of O
the O
community O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2020; O
and O
second O
to O
enable O
young O
people O
between O
14 O
and O
19 O
years O
old O
to O
contribute O
their O
ideas O
to O
the O
vision.
The O
project O
was O
coined O
‘Visions, O
Values O
and O
Goals O
for O
our O
Municipality O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2020’.
Therefore, O
the O
ideas O
needed O
to O
be O
developed O
into O
short O
stories, O
which O
should O
show O
desired O
descriptions O
of O
Lundal O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2020.
In O
the O
USA, O
for O
example, O
the O
number O
of O
people O
with O

will O
rise O
from O
24 O
million O
to O
44 O

people O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2034 O
if O
current O
trends O
continue O
and O
the O
cost O
will O
triple O
from O
$113 O

annually O
to O
$336 O

annually[4]
In O
India, O
the O

from O

is O
expected O
to O
increase O
from O
40% O
in O

to O
67% O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
and O

on O

is O
expected O
to O
grow O
annually O
by O
13%’’.
For O
example, O
longer O
life O
spans O
will O
lead O
to O
a O
doubling O
of O
the O
world O
population O
with O

and O
alzheimer’s, O
from O
35 O
million O
to O
65 O

by U_TEMPPRED O

As O
for O
decision-makers, O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
the O
territorial O
image O
of O
Europe O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
result O
of O
a O
Wild O

(whatever O
it O
appears O
to O
be) O
than O
of O
the O
well-crafted O
policies O
developed O
during O
the O
same O
period O
is O
interesting O
to O
reflect O
upon.
The O
dollar O
thus O
loses O
its O
status O
as O
the O

currency O
and O
the O

thus O
becomes O

Indeed, O
the O
project O
developed O
strategic O
prospective O

for O
the O
future O
development O
of O
the O

Confronted O

this O

of O

by U_TEMPPRED O

declare O
the O

social O
model O
‘bankrupt’, O
halting O
almost O
all O
but O
the O
most O
basic O

The O
transport O
and O
energy O
policies O
followed O
up B_TEMPPRED O
to E_TEMPPRED O
2022 O
would O
simply O
magnify O
the O
effect O
produced O
by O
the O
Wild O

It O
is O
however O
unlikely O
that O
the O
countries O
of O
Central O
and O
Eastern O
Europe O
would O
have O
‘caught O
up’ O
by U_TEMPPRED O

(perhaps O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
few O

while O
the O

‘safety O

from O
many O

may O
actually O

them O

even O
more O

would O
have O

the O
case O
if O
a O

I O
anticipate O
that O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2020 O
roughly O
30% O
of O
any O
segment O
of O
activity O
that O
can O
be O
called O
‘‘infrastructure’’ O
will O
be O
open O
source, O
such O
as O
server O
and O
client O
tools, O
office O
applications, O

and O
operating O
systems.
In O
principle, O
all O
TEN O
projects O
(Trans-European O
Network) O
were O
expected O
to O
be O
completed O
by B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O
year E_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
but O
given O
the O
slow O
evolution O
of O
infrastructure O
investments, O
additional O
hypotheses O
were O
used O
to O
define O
which O

would O
be O
built.
Each O
scenario O
concluded O
with O
a O
final O
image O
of O
Europe O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
(the O
time O

of O
the O

The O

around O
496 O

how O

who O
turned O
to O

with O
no O

the O

In U_TEMPPRED O
2022, O
a O
twenty-eight O

after O
having O
learnt O
about O
her O

from O
a O

filed O
a O

against O
her O

for O
denying O
her O

of O
subsequent O

If O
there O
were O
other O
indications O
for O

like O
a O

it O

EIA O
projects O
that O
renewable O
energy O
will O
account O
for O
approximately O
11% O
of O
total O
energy O
consumption O
in B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O
year E_TEMPPRED O
2030.
Even O
in B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O
year E_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
renewable O
energy O
is O
not O
expected O
to O
make O
up O
a O
very O
large O
fraction O
of O
overall O
energy O
usage.
Under O
this O
scenario, O
renewable O
energy O
should O
be O
able O
to O
account O
for O
15–25% O
of O
total O

by B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O

at O
500 O

at O
around O

over O
a O

of E_TEMPPRED O
50 O

The O
IEA’s O
[17] O
450 O
scenario O
puts O
renewable O

(biomass O

at O
22% O
of O
total O

in B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O

The O

are O
spaced O

by B_TEMPPRED O

EIA O
[49] O
and O
IEA O

should O
be O

In O
comparison, O
the O
IEA O
[17] O
estimates O
that O

will O
account O
for O
approximately O
14% O

in B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O

[17] O
which O
is O
not O
too O
different O
from O
the O
IEA’s O
estimate O
of O
a O
12.6% O
share O
of O
total O

that O

accounted O
for O
in O
2007.
In O
the O
IEA’s O
450 O
energy O
scenario, O
a O
scenario O
in O
which O
government O

currently O
being O
discussed O
to O
address O
issues O
of O

effect O
of O

in O
the O

at O
450 O
ppm, O
the O

is O
expected O
to O
grow O
by O
10.4% O
per O
year O
between U_TEMPPRED O
2007 O
and U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
In O
fact O
the O
IEA O
now O
expects O
global O
oil O
production O
to O
peak O
around U_TEMPPRED O
2020.
According O
to O
official O
estimates, O
the O
pipe O
grid O
will O
be O
extended O
by O
11% O
in O
the O
first O
years O
and O
by O
20–23% O
as O
of U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
In B_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O
next E_TEMPPRED O
decade, O
other O
ongoing O
projects O
will O
serve O
to O
very O
significantly O
reduce O
gas O
flow O
through O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
European O
continent.
In O
this O
case, O
the O
increase O
in O
gas O
production O
through O
two O
next U_TEMPPRED O
decades O
will O
most O
likely O
be O
lower O
than O
forecast O
by O
the O
government.
This O
discount O
will O
be O
only O
partially O
offset O
by O
higher O
domestic O
prices, O
thus O
reducing O
Gazprom’s O
financial O
capacity O
to O
lead O
several O
simultaneous O
large O
projects O
over O
the O
next U_TEMPPRED O
decade.
In O
December O
2009, O
Russia O
and O
Turkmenistan O
have O
reached O
a O
new O
agreement O
for O
trading O
30 O
bcm O
annually O
over O
the O
next U_TEMPPRED O
three O
years.
Thus, O
government O
figures O
posit O
that O
the O
gas O
sold O
abroad O
from O
Russia O
will O
grow O
by O
40% O
in O
twenty O
years, O
from O
270 O
bcm O
in O
2008 O
to O
370 O
bcm O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
The O
increase O
would O
be O
minimal O
in O
the O
early O
years O
and O
grow O
at O
a O
faster O
rate O
between O
2015 O
and O
2030, O
so O
that O
the O
average O
annual O
rate O
over O
the O
whole O
period O
(2008–2030) O
would O
range O
between O
1.38% O
and O
1.69%, O
resulting O
in O
an O
export O
increase O
of O
about O
85 O
bcm, O
from O
205 O
bcm O
in O
2008 O
to O
290 O
bcm O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
However, O
despite O
this O
decline, O
the O
region O
will O
remain O
the O
main O
centre O
for O
global O
gas O
production O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
The O
Arctic O
coast, O
where O
fields O
(Yamal, O
Kara O
Sea, O
and O
Ob-Taz O
bay) O
are O
still O
untapped, O
would O
provide O
40% O
of O
output O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
16 O
The O
data O
source O
for O
official O
forecasts O
through U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
is O
Interfax.
It O
projects O
135–175 O
bcm O
by O
2020 O
and O
310– O
360 O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
Overall, O
new O
production O
regions O
which O
now O
provide O
20 O
bcm O
would O
produce O
350 O
bcm O
(of O
a O
total O
820 O
bcm) O
in O
2020, O
and O
580 O
bcm O
(of O
915 O
bcm) O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
As O
a O
result, O
sales O
to O
Europe O
could O
grow O
by O
50–60 O
bcm O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
Following O
government O
forecasts, O
export O
share O
will O
tend O
to O
stabilize O
at O
around O
50% O
from U_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
against O
an O
estimated O
national O
average O
of O
around O
33%.
However, O
demand O
growth O
is O
almost O
nil O
and O
the O
government O
foresees O
its O
decline O
from U_TEMPPRED O
2020.
Thus, O
the O
80 O
bcm O
currently O
consumed O
would O
rise O
to O
200 O
bcm O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
making O
China O
a O
large O
consumer O
capable O
of O
formalizing O
important O
agreements O
with O
Russia, O
as O
Chinese O
self-reliance O
is O
limited O
and O
most O
domestic O
consumption O
will O
have O
to O
be O
met O
by O
imports.
Therefore, O
new O
launches O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
occur O
before U_TEMPPRED O
2020, O
so O
until O
this O
date O
exports O
to O
Asia O
will O
depend O
crucially O
on O
the O
development O
of O
Sakhalin-2, O
while O
the O
continuity O
of O
Sakhalin-1 O
is O
subject O
to O
the O
resolution O
of O
tensions O
between O
Gazprom O
and O
its O
partners O
in O
the O
PSA.
Thus, O
gas O
output O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
would O
be O
860 O
bcm, O
compared O
to O
the O
915 O
bcm O
expected O
by O
the O
government.
The O
most O
plausible O
forecasts O
put O
the O
annual O
growth O
rate O
of O
consumption O
between O
1.4% O
and O
1.1%, O
so O
that O
the O
absolute O
level O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
would O
range O
between O
625 O
and O
585 O
bcm.
Gas O
drilling O
may O
further O
increase O
through U_TEMPPRED O
2020–2030, O
putting O
into O
operation O
either O
some O
Eastern O

(Krasnoyarsk, O

considerable O

three O

over B_TEMPPRED O

is O
about O

From O
this O

point, O
the O

begin: O
how O
unexpected O

years O
of O
formal O

that O
it O

for O

‘‘What O
are O
the O
criteria O
we O
start O
from O
when O
we O
decide O
the O
methods?’’ O
A O
usual O
non-exhaustive O
list O
of O
criteria O
[8] O
includes O
the O
following: O
main O
goals O
to O
reach O
(in-depth O
study, O
participatory O
experience, O
decision-makers’ O
involvement, O
capacity O
building, O
etc.); O
mainly O
exploratory O
or O
normative O
(transformative) O
approach; O
time O
horizon O
(20 O
or O
40 O
years O
ahead U_TEMPPRED O
?); O
limits O
of O
the O
studied O
system; O
main O
scale O
of O
the O
study O
(local, O
national, O
regional, O
etc.
What O
is O
the O
most O
suitable O
horizon? O
In O
order O
to O
convince O
decision-makers O
and O
to O
be O
in O
line O
with O
other O
foresight O
exercises O
in O
EU, O
2030 O
seems O
an O
acceptable O
horizon, O
although U_TEMPPRED O
2040 O
would O
have O
been O
more O
suitable O
due O
to O
the O
inherent O
time O
dynamics O
of O
the O
studied O
system.
Two O
scales O
could O
be O
involved: O
a O
national O
scale O
with O
working O
groups O
of O
national O
decision-makers O
describing O
what O
desirable O
future O
they O
envision O
for O
rural O
communities O
in O
Romania O
at U_TEMPPRED O
2030.
It O
is O
notable O
that O
China O
has O
already O
identified O
the O
‘Internet O
of O
Things’ O
as O
a O
goal O
to O
be O
achieved O
within B_TEMPPRED M_TEMPPRED O
the M_TEMPPRED O
next E_TEMPPRED O
five O
years, O
under O
its O
12th O
Five O
Year O
Plan.
By U_TEMPPRED O
2030, O
at O
the O
rate O
we O
are O
going, O
our O
industrial O
civilization O
will O
need O
the O
capacity O
of O
two O
planets O
to O
absorb O
its O
carbon O
dioxide O
and O
other O
wastes O
and O
provide O
for O
continued O
mining O
and O
exploitation O
of O
resources.
13 O
When O
we O
add O
in O
China’s O
planning O
system O
that O
directs O
finance O
towards O
favored O
investment, O
it O
could O
well O
have O
an O
energy O
system O
based O
on O
hydro, O
renewable O
and O
nuclear O
that O
generates O
more O
electric O
power O
than O
fossil O
fuels O
by O
2030, O
and O
eclipses O
fossil O
fuels O
as O
primary O
energy O
source O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2050.
From O
the O
perspective B_TEMPPRED O
of E_TEMPPRED O
2050, O
when O
the O
shift O
to O
renewables O
will O
be O
well O
under O
way O
and O
acquiring O
unstoppable O
momentum, O
the O
idea O
that O
we O
could O
mortgage O
the O
future O
of O
our O
industrial O
civilization O
to O
a O
finite O
resource O
whose O
exploitation O
made O
countries O
the O
pawns O
of O
those O
endowed O
by O
chance O
with O
supplies, O
and O
encouraged O
brutal O
dictatorships O
to O
protect O
it, O
and O
whose O
burning O
was O
effectively O
poisoning O
the O
planet O
– O
such O
an O
idea O
will O
appear O
preposterous.
Again O
from O
the O
perspective B_TEMPPRED O
of E_TEMPPRED O
2050, O
when O
this O
process O
will O
be O
well O
advanced, O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
origin O
of O
resources O
could O
be O
ignored, O
and O
commodities O
could O
be O
produced O
and O
traded O
in O
a O
‘generic’ O
form O
without O
regard O
to O
their O
origins, O
will O
be O
regarded O
as O
benighted.
Several O
visions O

were O

a O

describes O

in B_TEMPPRED O

The O

explicitly O
note O
that O
it O

that O
they O

Fisk O
points O
out O
that O
‘The O

it O

The O
British O
government O
has O

carbon O

by O
80% O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2050, O
a O
very O
ambitious O
goal.
The O
report O
argues O
that O
this O
amount O

is O
achievable O
at O
an O
affordable O
cost O
of O
between O
1% O

2% O

Pielke[16] O
further O
argues O
that O
not O
only O
‘is O

These O

only O
a O

the O

(by U_TEMPPRED O

when O
the O

In O
his O
review O
of O
Davis’ O
work, O
Harding O
writes O
that O
the O
‘‘slumization O
of O
the O

deserves O
more O
global O
attention, O
given O
that O
by U_TEMPPRED O
2020 O
half O
the O
world’s O
urban O
population O
will O
exist O
in O
poverty.
The O
‘how’ O
of O
city O
futures O
To O
respond O
to O
these O
and O
other O
potential O
changes, O
many O
cities O
have O
embarked O
on U_TEMPPRED O
2030 O
type O
projects O
where O
they O
map O
possible O
and O
plausible O
futures O
and O
then O
create O
their O
desired O
future.
The O
participants O
wanted O
to O
begin O
the O
process O
of O
thinking O
about U_TEMPPRED O
2046 O
since O
they O
understood O
that O
climate O
change O
was O
a O
long O
term O
issue.
Multiple O
issues: O
climate O

and O
protecting O

Gold O

Another O
group O
that O
has O
taken O
a O
longer O
term O
approach O
is O
the O
Gold O
Coast O
City O
Council O
(focused O
on U_TEMPPRED O
2038).
Since O
the O
Vision’s O
refreshment O
in B_TEMPPRED O
the E_TEMPPRED O
2026 O
project O
(and O
this O
is O
part O
of O
the O
pendulum O
swing O
of O
local O
politics), O
the O
focus O
has O
not O
been O
on O
challenging O
the O
current O
direction O
of O
the O
city O
but O
on O
implementing O
large O
scale O
infrastructure O
projects, O
such O
as O
building O
tunnels.
In O
order O
to O
calculate O
a O

an O
assessment O
needs O
to O
be O
made O
of O
the O
total O
settlement O
costs O
in U_TEMPPRED O
2025 O
and O
2150 O
on O
the O
assumption O
that O
the O
urban O
and O
rural O
housing O
planning O
standards O
are O
achieved.
As O
the O
proportion O
of O
the O
urban O
population O
is O
expected O
to O
increase O
from O

60% O
to O
90% O
in O
the O
period O
from U_TEMPPRED O
2025 O

2150, O
the O
rural O
settlement O
