In 2017, the government of China put out its plan to lead the world in Artificial Intelligence by 2030. According to Eric Schmidt "it's pretty simple. By 2020, they will have caught up. By 2025, they will be better than us. By 2030, they will dominate the industries of AI."

And the numbers don't lie, says Peter Diamandis: "PricewaterhouseCoopers recently projected AI's deployment will add $15.7 trillion to the global GDP by 2030, with China taking home $7 trillion of that total, dwarfing North America's $3.7 trillion in gains."Colors are Blue
