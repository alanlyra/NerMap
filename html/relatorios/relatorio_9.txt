In 2030, China will lead the world in Artificial Intelligence. According to Eric Schmidt “it’s pretty simple. By 2020, China will have caught up. By 2025, China will be better than USA. For the year of 2030, China will dominate the industries of AI.”

And the numbers don’t lie, says Peter Diamandis: “PricewaterhouseCoopers recently projected AI’s deployment will add $15.7 trillion to the global GDP by 2030, with China taking home $7 trillion of that total, dwarfing North America’s $3.7 trillion in gains.”
