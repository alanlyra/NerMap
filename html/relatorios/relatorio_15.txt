So the company CEO will still be human in 2025, but what about the board of directors? Board members who just use anecdotal evidence and 30 years of gut experience to evaluate major decisions aren’t going to cut it in today’s environment, says Warren Stippich, who advises corporate boards as a partner in Advisory Services at professional-services firm Grant Thornton LLP. In many cases, adding an artificial-intelligence tool to the boardroom, Stippich says, could help synthesize the massive amounts of data board members are being asked to review and help improve decision-making.

Robots on the board isn’t that uncommon of a dream. In another World Economic Forum survey, nearly half of executives said that there will be an AI appointed to a firm’s board of directors by 2025. Already, IBM Corp. is using an algorithm to help its directors evaluate potential acquisition targets. (Big Blue hasn’t yet put a supercomputer on its corporate board.)
